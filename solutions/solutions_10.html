The circuit court held that the insured’s failure to comply with the “Notice of Circumstance” provision precluded coverage under the Lexington policy and granted summary judgment in favor of Lexington. On appeal, Federal contends the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Lexington because sufficient notice was provided as outlined in the insurance policy. We affirm.\nWe adopt the facts as outlined in the judgment of the circuit court.\nIn October 1998, Jose Barajas was seriously injured by a detonator manufactured by the Ensign-Bickford Company (Ensign) and sold by American East Explosives, Inc. (American East). American East, doing business then as Evenson Explosives, is a subsidiary of ETI Canada, Inc. (ETI). At the time of the accident, American East and Ensign were insured by National Union Fire Insurance Company (National Union). Defendant Lexington was their excess carrier from November 29, 1997, through November 29, 1998, and plaintiff, Federal, provided excess coverage from November 29, 1998, through November 29, 1999.\nOn April 18, 2000, Barajas and his spouse filed suit against American East, Ensign, and others, for his injuries. National Union agreed to defend American East and Ensign, and Federal agreed to provide excess coverage. Lexington refused to participate, contending the Barajas claim was not covered under its policy. Once the Barajas litigation settled, Federal filed the instant lawsuit seeking to recover its portion of the settlement from Lexington.\nThe parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on Federal’s four-count complaint for declaratory relief, indemnification, breach of contract damages, and contribution. The circuit court granted Lexington summary judgment on the four-count complaint and denied summary judgment to Federal. Federal filed this timely appeal.\nAt issue is the notice of circumstance in Lexington’s policy:\n“Whenever the Insured has information relating to a Circumstance which is likely to involve this Policy and gives notice of such Circumstance, in writing, sent by registered or certified mail during the period of this Policy, to the entity designated in Item 4 of the Declarations, then any claim, as respects such Circumstance, which is made, in writing, against the Insured within seven years from the date of the written notification of such Circumstance, to said entity, shall be deemed to have been first made, in writing, against the Insured on the date upon which the notice of the said Circumstance was first sent to said entity, in writing.\nIt is noted that this Insuring Agreement 4 is an option for the Insured and not an obligation and does not alter the provisions of Condition (D) — REPORTING OF LOSSES.” (Emphasis added.)\nWillis Corroon Corporation of Seattle (Willis) is the entity-designated in Item 4. At the time of the Barajas accident, Willis also was American East’s broker in charge of handling all of American East’s general and auto liability claims and the reporting of all those after being notified.\nIt is undisputed American East did not provide Willis with written notification of the Barajas incident. American East’s administrative and risk manager, Carl Clauss, did telephone Willis’s representative, Stanley Heydrick, on the day of the incident or the day after and notified him of the incident. Heydrick does not remember requesting written notice of the Barajas accident, but believes he forwarded the Barajas information to Mr. Jim Sorte in the claims department, which then put National Union, the primary insurer, on notice.\nThe learned trial court correctly stated the standard. “The construction of an insurance policy and a determination of the rights and obligations thereunder are questions of law for the court which are appropriate subjects for disposition by way of summary judgment.” Crum &amp; Forster Managers Corp. v. Resolution Trust Corp., 156 Ill. 2d 384, 391 (1993). Summary judgment should be granted only where the pleadings, depositions, admissions and affidavits, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, show that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Film &amp; Tape Works, Inc. v. Junetwenty Films, Inc., 368 Ill. App. 3d 462, 468 (2006). While summary judgment may aid the expeditious disposition of a lawsuit, it is a drastic means of disposing of litigation and therefore should be allowed only when the right of the moving party is clear and free from doubt. Purtill v. Hess, 111 Ill. 2d 229, 240 (1986). When parties file cross-motions for summary judgment, they concede the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and invite the court to decide the questions presented as a matter of law. Steadfast Insurance Co. v. Caremark Rx, Inc., 359 Ill. App. 3d 749, 755 (2005). Our review is de novo. Steadfast Insurance Co., 359 Ill. App. 3d at 755.\nA proper analysis of the sufficiency of notice is whether the notice given objectively complied with the potential claim notice provision of a policy. Continental Casualty Co. v. Coregis Insurance Co., 316 Ill. App. 3d 1052, 1063 (2000).\nOn appeal, Federal contends the notice was sufficient because: (1) there was oral notice by telephone the next day that was intended as notice; and (2) notice by fax to AIG Claim Services, Inc. (AIG/CS), was sufficient written notice as Lexington, National Union and AIG/CS are all part of the American International Group, Inc. (AIG), corporate group.\nWe disagree. Mr. Clauss testified at his deposition in pertinent part:\n“Q. At the time ETI provided notice of or notified Willis of the Barajas accident, did you understand that there was a possibility that Mr. Barajas’s injuries would result in a claim against ETI or one of its subsidiaries?\nA. No.\nQ. And why do you say that?\nA. Because we sold product to a customer that did their own blasting. The product was loaded in the hole by Material Service’s employees. Therefore, the only way that ETI should have been involved in the litigation or in the claim would be if it was deemed that the product was defective and that was one of the results of why the accident occurred.\nQ. Okay. A day after the accident occurred, was it known whether the product was deemed defective?\nA. No.\nQ. So is it fair to say that Willis was notified of the Barajas accident in case the product involved in the Barajas accident was deemed defective?\nA. That was always the prudent thing to do.\ns¡t * *\nQ. When notice was provided to Willis of the Barajas accident, did you intend to put all carriers on notice of the incident?\n***\nA. That would have been Willis’s decision.\nQ. Was it your understanding that Willis would put the carriers on notice of the Barajas incident?\n***\nA. I feel that they did the right thing, which was notify [National Union,] [which] had a million dollars’ worth of coverage since I didn’t expect it to be a claim.”\nFurther, Willis’s claims representative, Jim Sorte, testified in his deposition in pertinent part:\n“Q. [D]id you in your capacity with Willis in 1998/1999, in those years, did you have the authority to unilaterally decide to put an ETI excess insurer on notice of an incident or claim without first discussing it with Mr. Clauss?\n***\nA. No.\nQ. Would it be fair to say that before anyone at Willis with respect to the ETI account could put an excess insurer on notice of an incident, occurrence or claim, Willis first needed the approval and authority of Mr. Clauss to do so?\n***\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did Mr. Clauss on October 13 of 1998 or at any time ever ask you to put Lexington on notice of the Barajas case under the Lexington claims-made excess policy in effect between November of 1997 and November of 1998?\nA. I don’t believe so, no.”\nThis testimony reveals that Mr. Clauss did not instruct Willis to put Lexington on notice of the Barajas claim; rather, he left it to Willis to figure out which carrier to notify. Mr. Clauss further stated he believed Willis did the “right thing” in notifying National Union (and not the excess carrier Lexington) because Mr. Clauss did not expect a claim to be made.\nOn this record, there simply is no evidence that American East notified Willis, either by telephone or in writing, that it should put Lexington on notice of the Barajas accident. Accordingly, the circuit court was correct in finding that American East failed to comply with the notice of circumstance provision of the Lexington policy.\nFederal contends Lexington received notice of the Barajas incident through an “Acord General Liability Notice of Occurrence Claim” (the Acord) Willis sent by fax to AIG, which was received by AIG/CS on October 14, 1998. Federal argues that Lexington and National Union are both AIG member companies and that AIG/CS accepts notices from brokers or policyholders on behalf of Lexington and National Union. Federal contends this court should find, as a matter of law, that notice to AIG, AIG/CS, or National Union constituted notice to Lexington.\nWe disagree. The Acord referenced only National Union, not Lexington. The Acord contained a section allowing identification of an “umbrella/excess policy in force”; however, this section was left blank by Willis. As aptly noted by the circuit court, “Merely because National Union fortuitously belonged to the same organization as Lexington does not impute notice of the Barajas incident to Lexington. Moreover, there is not even any evidence suggesting that the sender of the Acord intended to notify anyone other than National Union, the only insurer identified therein, of the Barajas incident.”\nFederal also argues:\n“The Lexington Policy’s Other Insurance provision conflicts with the Federal Policy’s Other Insurance provisions because both policies purport to make their insurance excess of all other applicable insurance. Since the Other Insurance provisions are mutually repugnant, this Court should disregard them, and require both insurer[s] to contribute on a pro rata basis, which [in] this case would require Lexington to reimburse Federal for one-half of the settlement of the Barajas lawsuit, plus interest.”\nFederal’s argument is unavailing. As discussed above, Federal is not entitled to any reimbursement from Lexington due to .the insured’s failure to comply with the notice of circumstance provision of the Lexington policy.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit court.\nAffirmed.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

The trial court sentenced the defendant to 364 days’ imprisonment. The defendant appealed, contending that his domestic battery conviction must be reversed and his endangering the life or health of a child conviction must be vacated because the trial court improperly admitted a hearsay statement of Melissa Connolly. We affirm.\nFACTS\nThe charges against the defendant arose from an argument between the defendant and his wife, Melissa, outside their home. The couple’s neighbor, Dina Perritano, testified that she was sleeping on her couch after working all night when her son woke her up because the defendant and Melissa were arguing outside. Perritano went outside and observed Melissa seated in the driver’s seat of her vehicle and the defendant standing in the open doorway of the vehicle, holding their son on his hip. Perritano testified that the defendant and Melissa were screaming and yelling at each other, and Melissa threatened to call the police. Perritano returned to her home and telephoned the police. When she turned back toward the argument, the child was sitting in the middle of the two-lane street and the defendant was leaning over Melissa while screaming at her. Perritano estimated that the child was in the middle of the street for a few minutes. Perritano saw a car coming slowly down the street, but it came to a stop and the defendant picked up the child and left. Melissa remained in her vehicle until the police arrived. Perritano estimated that the police arrived a few minutes after the defendant left with the child. When the police officer arrived that day, he spoke separately to Melissa and then spoke to Perritano.\nJon Muehlbauer, a deputy with the Will County sheriffs department, testified he arrived at the scene within five to seven minutes after he was dispatched. He first spoke to Melissa, who appeared upset, agitated, and nervous upon his arrival. The defense objected to allowing Muehlbauer to testify as to what Melissa told him, but the trial court overruled the objection, finding an adequate foundation, and allowed Melissa’s statements to be admitted under the excited utterance exception to hearsay. Muehlbauer went on to testify that Melissa told him that the defendant pulled her out of her vehicle and battered her about the head. Melissa also told Muehlbauer that the defendant put the child down in the middle of the street. The deputy did not recall seeing injuries on Melissa. He then spoke to Perritano and the driver of the car that stopped. Muehlbauer attempted to locate the defendant, but could not find him. Muehlbauer located the child in a residence down the street and returned the child to his mother, Melissa. The State rested, and the defendant’s motion for a directed verdict was denied.\nMelissa testified for the defense. She stated that, at the time of the incident, their child was 19 months old. Melissa testified that she had an argument with the defendant, but that he did not strike her and he never set the child down. She testified that she was calm when she spoke to Muehlbauer about 10 minutes after the argument.\nThe defendant also testified. He denied putting the child in the street. He testified that he had an argument with Melissa, but he could not recall what it was about. He heard Perritano say that she was calling the police, but he did not run away with the child. According to the defendant, he was taking the child for a walk in his stroller.\nThe jury found the defendant guilty of both offenses, and the defendant’s motion for a new trial was denied. At sentencing, the trial judge noted that the defendant and Melissa were “two of the least believable witnesses [he] ever heard” in the two decades he had been licensed to practice law and sentenced the defendant to 364 days’ imprisonment.\nANALYSIS\nThe defendant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting Melissa’s statements to the officer under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. The defendant also contends that the admission of Melissa’s statements violated the confrontation clause of the United States Constitution (U.S. Const., amend. VI). The defendant argues that if Melissa’s out-of-court statements were improperly admitted by the court as an exception to the hearsay rule, double jeopardy bars his retrial for domestic battery.\nThe State contends the trial court properly admitted Melissa’s responses to the officer’s questions as an excited utterance. Alternatively, the State submits that even if an error occurred, there is no double jeopardy bar to a retrial on these charges.\nWe begin by considering the defendant’s argument that Melissa’s statements constituted inadmissible hearsay. Out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted are inadmissible hearsay and considered to lack reliability unless an exception applies. People v. Tenney, 205 Ill. 2d 411 (2002).\nThe State offered Melissa’s out-of-court statements to the jury for the truth of the matters asserted, so her statements were hearsay unless an exception applied. The trial court found that the excited utterance, or spontaneous declaration, exception applied, and it admitted the statements.\nOur supreme court has explained that the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule is based on human experience. That is, where people are under physical or mental shock, they experience a stress of nervous excitement which produces a statement that expresses the real belief of the speaker as to the facts just observed. People v. Damen, 28 Ill. 2d 464 (1963). It is not unusual for the State to attempt to utilize the excited utterance exception when appropriate. See, e.g., People v. Gwinn, 366 Ill. App. 3d 501 (2006); People v. Robinson, 379 Ill. App. 3d 679 (2008), appeal allowed, 228 Ill. 2d 548 (2008) (table). Given the studied psychological dynamics of domestic violence (see generally Mary A.\nDutton, Understanding Women’s Responses to Domestic Violence: A Redefinition of Battered Woman Syndrome, 21 Hofstra L. Rev. 1191 (1993)), efforts by the State to rely on the hearsay exception might arise from the recognition that domestic violence is a type of crime that is very susceptible to intimidation of the victim to ensure the victim does not testify against the abuser. See People v. Dabbs, 239 Ill. 2d 277 (2010) (discussing the legitimate concern of the General Assembly with the effective prosecution of crimes of domestic violence).\nFor the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule to apply, “there must be an occurrence sufficiently startling to produce a spontaneous and unreflecting statement, there must be an absence of time for the declarant to fabricate the statement, and the statement must relate to the circumstances of the occurrence.” People v. Sutton, 233 Ill. 2d 89, 107 (2009). Courts look at the totality of the circumstances to determine whether a statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception. People v. Williams, 193 Ill. 2d 306 (2000). An event can be sufficiently startling, even in the absence of physical injury, based on the totality of the circumstances. Robinson, 379 Ill. App. 3d 679.\nWhile the amount of time necessary for fabrication may vary greatly, the critical inquiry with regard to time is whether the statement was made while the declarant was still affected by the excitement of the event. Sutton, 233 Ill. 2d 89. The time factor is not viewed in isolation, but in the context of the event. For example, a 15- to 20-minute delay between an incident of home invasion and aggravated domestic battery and the victim’s statement to the police concerning the events does not destroy spontaneity under given circumstances. Gwinn, 366 Ill. App. 3d 501 (victim was crying, trembling, and visibly shaken, as well as injured, when she made the statement to officers).\nThe fact that a statement is made in response to an inquiry does not destroy spontaneity. People v. Lisle, 376 Ill. App. 3d 67 (2007), appeal denied, 226 Ill. 2d 597 (2007). In Damen, 28 Ill. 2d at 470, a forcible rape case, our supreme court noted the fact an officer asked the complainant “what happened” was insufficient to destroy its spontaneity. See also Williams, 193 Ill. 2d 306. In another case, when the statements are made in respect to a police officer’s questions more than 20 minutes after the crime had occurred, the victim’s statement was still considered a spontaneous declaration. Sutton, 233 Ill. 2d 89 (victim’s statement made while excitement of the event predominated). An excited utterance can still be made even after having spoken previously to another after the event. See People v. House, 141 Ill. 2d 323 (1990) (rejecting the argument that a declarant cannot make a spontaneous declaration to a person after having spoken previously to another).\nThe trial court in the instant case determined that Melissa’s statements were admissible as excited utterances, so our review is limited to whether that determination was an abuse of discretion. People v. Cookson, 215 Ill. 2d 194 (2005). Evidentiary rulings are within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we review those rulings with deference to the trial court. People v. Caffey, 205 Ill. 2d 52 (2001). This court will find an abuse of discretion only where the trial court’s ruling is arbitrary, fanciful, unreasonable, or where no reasonable person could take the view adopted by the trial court. Caffey, 205 Ill. 2d 52. Inasmuch as the application of the excited utterance exception always depends on the circumstances of the particular case, it has been suggested that the trial court should be clothed with a reasonable degree of latitude. Peterson v. Cochran &amp; McCluer Co., 308 Ill. App. 348 (1941); see 6 John H. Wigmore, Evidence §1750 (Chadbourn rev. ed. 1976).\nIn this case, the totality of the circumstances supports the trial court’s finding that Melissa’s statements were excited utterances. Domestic violence is an intolerable offense sufficiently startling to render inoperative the normal reflective thought processes of the victim. Her statements were made within a relatively short time span following the occurrence that allowed the emotional upset to continue. There does not appear to have been any time for reflection by Melissa prior to her statements to the police officer. Muehlbauer arrived on the scene within minutes of the argument between Melissa and the defendant. Melissa was still at the scene in a nervous, upset, and agitated condition, directly related to the event. Her child was absent. The defendant was no longer at the scene, and he had taken the child. Muehlbauer left Melissa at the scene to look for the defendant and the child. We find no abuse of discretion in the conclusion that Melissa’s responses to police questioning on the scene were excited utterances and were admissible.\nHaving determined that Melissa’s statements to Muehlbauer were admissible as exceptions to hearsay, we must address the constitutional issue based on the confrontation clause. Melissa did not testify for the State, so she was not subject to cross-examination for purposes of the sixth amendment confrontation clause. See Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305 (2009) (confrontation clause imposes a burden on the prosecution, not the defendant, to produce witnesses against the defendant).\nThe confrontation clause provides that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right *** to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amends. VI, XIV. A testimonial out-of-court statement by a witness who does not testify at trial is not admissible unless the witness is unavailable to testify and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004); People v. Stechly, 225 Ill. 2d 246 (2007). The confrontation clause does not apply, however, if the statements are not testimonial. Stechly, 225 Ill. 2d 246.\nThe trial court found that Melissa’s statements were not testimonial and, thus, did not violate the confrontation clause with their admission into evidence. A sixth amendment confrontation clause violation claim is a question of law that we review de novo. People v. Williams, 238 Ill. 2d 125 (2010); People v. Lovejoy, 235 Ill. 2d 97 (2009).\nA statement is testimonial if it is made in a solemn fashion and is intended to establish a particular fact. Stechly, 225 Ill. 2d 246. However, just because a statement was made to a police officer, standing alone, does not mean the statement is prohibited. A statement made to a law enforcement official is not testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that the primary purpose of any questioning was to address an ongoing emergency. Sutton, 233 Ill. 2d 89. The Davis court applied four factors when deciding whether interrogation was to meet an ongoing emergency: whether the purpose was to determine a past fact or ascertain an ongoing event; whether the situation could be described as an emergency; whether the nature of the questions focused on the present or on the past; and finally, the level of formality involved. Davis v. Washington, 547 U.S. 813 (2006). In such circumstances, the objective intent of the questioner, not the questioner’s status, becomes the determinative question. In re Rolandis G., 232 Ill. 2d 13 (2008).\nMuehlbauer testified that when he arrived at the scene, Melissa was still at the scene and she appeared upset, nervous, and agitated. He first talked to Melissa. She told him that the defendant had pulled her out of her vehicle and battered her about the head, and that the defendant had set the child in the middle of the street. The defendant had also taken the child. After questioning the two other witnesses at the scene, assessing the ongoing situation, Muehlbauer proceeded to try to locate the defendant and the child. In fact, he eventually located the child and then returned the child to his mother, Melissa. We conclude that Melissa’s statements to Muehlbauer were nontestimonial because Muehlbauer was addressing an ongoing emergency. As such, the confrontation clause did not bar the admission of Melissa’s statements. Having found Melissa’s statements were an exception to the hearsay rule that did not violate the confrontation clause, we need not address the double jeopardy argument.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court of Will County is affirmed.\nAffirmed.\nThis excited utterance exception has a long history in the common law of evidence. See Thompson v. Trevanion, (1693) 90 Eng. Rep. 179 (K.B.) (in an action for trespass of the wife of the plaintiff, Chief Justice Holt found that what the wife said immediately upon the hurt received, and before there was time to contrive anything, might be given in evidence); see generally 6 John H. Wigmore, Evidence §§1747 through 1750 (Chadbourn rev. ed. 1976).&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}, {&#39;author&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE WRIGHT,&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE WRIGHT,\ndissenting:\nIn this case, the couple’s neighbor, Dina Perritano, testified that she observed defendant and Melissa screaming and yelling at each other outside their residence while Melissa was seated in the driver’s seat of her vehicle. Perritano observed defendant was standing in the open doorway of the vehicle, holding their son on his hip. During this verbal argument, Perritano heard Melissa threaten to call the police. Perritano did not observe any physical contact between the couple but called the police on her own initiative. Perritano estimated that the police arrived a few minutes later after defendant left with his son.\nJon Muehlbauer, a deputy with the Will County sheriff’s department, testified he arrived at the scene within five to seven minutes after he was dispatched to that location. He spoke to Melissa, who told him that defendant pulled her out of her vehicle and battered her about the head. The officer described her to be upset and nervous.\nFor the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule to apply, “there must be an occurrence sufficiently startling to produce a spontaneous and unreflecting statement, there must be an absence of time for the declarant to fabricate the statement, and the statement must relate to the circumstances of the occurrence.” People v. Sutton, 233 Ill. 2d 89, 107 (2009). In this case, I conclude that the events witnessed by the neighbor do not indicate that there was a sufficiently startling event or the required spontaneity to trigger this narrow and inflexible exception to the hearsay rule.\nGenerally, many people who speak to investigating officers are both upset and nervous. The excited utterance requires something more, that is, a sufficiently startling event to trigger a spontaneous declaration. Mere nervousness and anxiety are not enough.\nHere, the neighbor’s testimony established that heated verbal altercations were not unusual for this couple and that the police officer arrived on the scene between 5 and 10 minutes after the couple separated. This time period would allow sufficient time for Melissa’s personal reflection, thereby negating the spontaneity of her responses to the officer’s questions. Based on the circumstances of this case, it is unclear whether Melissa was upset because her child had been removed from the area by his father or upset by the purported altercation.\nIn my view, the foundation for an excited utterance exception should not vary due to the domestic nature of the underlying offense or based on the reality that the State cannot prove its case without the statement. In this case, the State’s evidence neither satisfied the requirement that the occurrence in this case was startling for this declarant and also failed to establish there was not an opportunity for the declarant’s reflection. Thus, I have reached the conclusion that Melissa’s out-of-court statement to Muehlbauer constituted inadmissible hearsay and requires reversal of defendant’s conviction.\nNext, based on my position as set forth above, I reject defendant’s contention that a retrial for domestic battery is barred based upon double jeopardy considerations. Double jeopardy does not prevent a retrial when a conviction is overturned due to an error in the trial. People v. Lopez, 229 Ill. 2d 322, 367 (2008). When deciding if the evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction, for double jeopardy purposes, this court may consider all of the evidence admitted at trial, even the erroneously admitted evidence. If viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, a rational trier of fact could have found all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, there is no double jeopardy bar to retrial. People v. Lopez, 229 Ill. 2d at 367.\nIn this case, Melissa told the police officer that defendant had pulled her out of the car and battered her about the head. Moreover, upon remand, Melissa could change her mind and elect to testify for the State in a fashion that is consistent with her out-of-court statements to the officer. Viewing all of the evidence, including the improperly admitted evidence, I conclude that a reasonable trier of fact could have found defendant guilty of domestic battery.\nAs for defendant’s conviction of endangering the life or health of a child, the State contends that retrial is not warranted because any error was harmless. Although there was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction, the impact of the erroneous admission of Melissa’s statements to the officer cannot be considered harmless in this case. See People v. Stechly, 225 Ill. 2d 246 (2007).\nConsequently, I would find the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the out-of-court statement as a spontaneous utterance, vacate both convictions, and remand the cause for a new trial on both charges.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;dissent&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

After a hearing, the circuit court denied the petition. On appeal, Victor raises issues regarding whether the circuit court erred by denying the petition on the grounds of standing, without holding an evidentiary hearing on the issue. We reverse and remand with directions.\nFACTS\nOn April 27, 2010, Victor filed a petition under the Probate Act, seeking the guardianship of A.G.G., a minor, born in 2007. See 755 ILCS 5/11 — 5 (West 2008). Victor stated that he had been caring for A.G.G. for the previous three years. Victor alleged that A.G.G.’s mother, Jennifer Greer, has been unable and unwilling to care for her and had relinquished that responsibility to him. Victor further alleged that A.G.G.’s biological father was unable and unwilling to care for her, as evidenced by the lack of any involvement in A.G.G.’s life since her birth. At the same time, Victor filed a motion to enter an interim order and appoint a guardian ad litem.\nThe following day the court made a docket entry and entered a separate written order. In the docket entry, the court stated that the petition did not contain any detail on the relationship of Victor to A.G.G. and did not set forth all the allegations required by the Probate Act (755 ILCS 5/11 — 3 (West 2008)). The docket entry stated that Victor had 14 days to comply and that attorney Eugenia Hunter was appointed as the guardian ad litem. The written order of that date also stated that Hunter was appointed as the guardian ad litem. On May 11, 2010, Victor filed an amended petition for guardianship, in which he alleged that he was not the biological father of A.G.G. but was the only father figure A.G.G. has ever known.\nOn June 2, 2010, the court entered an interim order stating that the cause had been heard on the pending petition for a guardianship and a motion to enter an interim order. The order appointed Hunter as the guardian ad litem and authorized her to appoint Victor as the guardian if she deemed it to be in A.G.G.’s best interests. The order granted custody to Victor for the pendency of the proceedings.\nOn June 7, 2010, Jennifer filed a motion to dismiss the amended petition for a guardianship. Jennifer asserted that the allegations in the amended petition did not overcome the presumption that she is willing and able to carry out day-to-day child care decisions for A.G.G. Jennifer asserted that, thus, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to proceed on the petition. See 755 ILCS 5/11 — 5(b) (West 2008). Jennifer also filed a motion to vacate the interim order.\nOn June 7, 2010, the court entered several docket entries and a written order. In one of the docket entries, the court stated: “Court hears motion to vacate 6/2/10 Interim Order. Court continues Mot/ Vacate, Motion to Dismiss.” In the written order, the court set “[a]ll pending” matters for June 21, 2010. On June 18, 2010, Victor filed a response to the motion to dismiss.\nOn June 21, 2010, the guardian ad litem submitted a report outlining her interviews of Jennifer, Victor, and A.G.G. The guardian ad litem stated that Jennifer “has difficulty with the truth or an exceptionally faulty memory.” The guardian ad litem also noted that despite being educated, Jennifer had a sporadic work record and did not have the ability to support herself. The guardian ad litem reported that Jennifer had lived in approximately nine locations in the previous five years and was homeless at the time of the report. The guardian ad litem concluded as follows:\n“If this were a custody case in which ‘best interest’ was the legal issue, I would have no hesitancy in recommending that the best interests of [A.G.G.] were with Victor Eck. This is, however, a guardianship case in which the standard is different and more complex. For this reason, I would prefer to withhold a recommendation until the evidence and testimony are presented.”\nOn June 21, 2010, the court called the case for a hearing. The court began by discussing Jennifer’s motion to dismiss for a lack of standing. Upon direct questioning by the court, the guardian ad litem responded that she thought Jennifer was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue of standing. At that point, counsel for Jennifer stated that Victor had to meet the threshold of standing before the best interests of the child could be considered and that the guardian ad litem’s opinion should be limited to the issue of best interests. The court responded, “[The report of the guardian ad litem] has raised some concerns that the Court had and I think that this Court does have the inherent power, whether or not we get past that initial step, to look out for the best interest of the child; and I have some real concerns that have been raised by the guardian ad litem’s report and we’re going to have evidence today and I’m going to make a determination.”\nJennifer’s counsel responded by asking the court whether this meant that the motion to dismiss had been denied. The court responded by asking if Jennifer’s counsel would like to make an argument or statement for the record. The colloquy continued:\n“[Counsel for Jennifer:] Certainly, your Honor. Then I would just like to state for the record that it is my understanding that the motion to dismiss this petition for guardianship has actually been based on a best standards or best interest of the child’s standard and not on the statute under the Probate Act?\nTHE COURT: Are you asking the Court a question, Ms. Coward?\n[Counsel for Jennifer:] I — originally, your Honor, I asked if the motion to dismiss had been denied.\nTHE COURT: Well I’ll deny the motion to dismiss.\n[Counsel for Jennifer:] Okay, and just for clarification, your Honor, it’s being denied based on best interest of the child standard, is that correct?\nTHE COURT: You don’t wish to argue your motion?\n[Counsel for Jennifer:] No. That’s a question, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: No, it’s not being denied under the best interest of the child. This Court has inherent authority to look out for the best interest of the child and that’s why we’re proceeding on the amended petition today.”\nThe court made the following docket entry: “6/21/10 Case called[;] parties, counsel, GA all present. Ct Denies Mot/D, proceeds to hearing on A.Pet.” The court noted that after denying the motion to dismiss, it conducted a hearing over two days, at which both Victor and Jennifer presented testimony from several witnesses. The docket entry concluded, “Court finds that [Victor] has not proved by a preponderance of evidence that [Jennifer] as natural mother is not willing and able to make and carry out day-to-day child care decisions concerning the minor as per 5/11 — 5(b).” On June 28, 2010, the court entered a written order denying the petition on the grounds that Victor had failed to rebut the presumption that Jennifer is willing and able to carry out day-to-day child care decisions.\nVictor appeals.\nANALYSIS\nThe results of the procedure used by the trial court are inherently unreliable. At the beginning of the proceedings of June 21, 2010, the trial court denied Jennifer’s request to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the issue of standing. The court then proceeded to entertain evidence seemingly on the best interests of the minor. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court denied the petition, applying the standard for standing. The failure of the court to entertain a hearing on the standard on which it denied the petition undermines the credibility of its ruling and mandates a reversal.\nSection 11 — 5 of the Probate Act dictates the grounds for the appointment of a guardian. 755 ILCS 5/11 — 5 (West 2008). In order to grant a petition for a guardianship, a trial court must make two evidentiary findings. Paragraph (a) provides that upon the filing of a petition the court may appoint a guardian as “the court finds to be in the best interest of the minor.” 755 ILCS 5/11 — 5(a) (West 2008). Paragraph (b) provides that a court lacks jurisdiction to proceed on a petition if the minor has a parent “whose parental rights have not been terminated, whose whereabouts are known, and who is willing and able to make and carry out day-to-day child care decisions concerning the minor.” 755 ILCS 5/11 — 5(b) (West 2008).\nThe standards of the best interests of the minor, in paragraph (a), and a parent who is “willing and able,” in paragraph (b), are separate questions of fact. Historically, Illinois courts have found guidance in the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act (Marriage Act) when determining the best interests of a minor in guardianship proceedings. 750 ILCS 5/602(a) (West 2008); In re Marriage of Russell, 169 Ill. App. 3d 97, 102, 523 N.E.2d 193, 197 (1988); In re Estate of Suggs, 149 Ill. App. 3d 793, 799, 501 N.E.2d 307, 310 (1986). After the recent amendment to the provision for the revocation of a guardianship, effective January 1, 2011, the Probate Act lists factors for determining best interests, including the interaction with the parent, the ability of the parent to provide a nurturing environment, and the stability of the parties. Pub. Act 96 — 1338 (eff. Jan. 1, 2011) (amending 755 ILCS 5/11 — 14.1 (West 2008)).\nThe question of whether a parent meets the willing-and-able standard set forth in paragraph (b) is a separate test from the best-interests-of-the-minor standard. Paragraph (b) sets forth a threshold for standing under the Probate Act that replaces a previous interpretation derived from the Marriage Act. In re R.L.S., 218 Ill. 2d 428, 436, 844 N.E.2d 22, 28 (2006), abrogating In re Person &amp; Estate of New-some, 173 Ill. App. 3d 376, 379, 527 N.E.2d 524, 525 (1988); In re Marriage of Haslett, 257 Ill. App. 3d 999, 1006, 629 N.E.2d 182, 186 (1994); In re Person &amp; Estate of Barnhart, 232 Ill. App. 3d 317, 320, 597 N.E.2d 1238, 1240 (1992). Paragraph (b) states, “There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a parent of a minor is willing and able to make and carry out day-to-day child care decisions concerning the minor, but the presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.” 755 ILCS 5/11 — 5(b) (West 2008).\nThe seminal case instructing on the appointments of guardians under the Probate Act is In re R.L.S., 218 Ill. 2d 428, 436, 844 N.E.2d 22, 28 (2006). In re R.L.S. held that the standing requirement contained in paragraph (b) protects the superior rights of parents and ensures that guardianship proceedings pass constitutional muster. In re R.L.S., 218 Ill. 2d at 441, 844 N.E.2d at 31. In re R.L.S. explained the procedural protections outlined in section 11 — 5:\n“By allowing a guardianship petition to proceed to a hearing on the merits over the wishes of a parent only when the parent has been established to be unwilling or unable to carry out day-to-day childcare decisions, the Probate Act respects the superior rights of parents while also insuring to protect the health, safety, and welfare of children.” In re R.L.S., 218 Ill. 2d at 441, 844 N.E.2d at 31.\nIn the case at hand, the trial court denied the request for an evidentiary hearing on the standing issue and proceeded to entertain evidence supposedly on the remaining question of best interests. After the evidentiary hearing, the court did not rule on the question of best interests but dismissed the petition on the standard for standing. The proceedings before the trial court were, at best, muddled. The process both diverged from the burden created by a rebuttable presumption and undermined any claim that the issue of standing was actually heard.\nThe court’s procedure displayed a misunderstanding of the nature of the standing requirement as a rebuttable presumption. Once a presumption is overcome, it ceases to operate. In re Estate of Miller, 334 Ill. App. 3d 692, 698, 778 N.E.2d 262, 267 (2002); In re J.A., 316 Ill. App. 3d 553, 562, 736 N.E.2d 678, 686 (2000). The record indicates that by the court’s prehearing comments and ruling on the motion to dismiss, the parties to the action were led to believe that the presumption had dissolved. Although the court might have initially erred against Jennifer by not holding a hearing on standing, the court prejudiced Victor by reviving the presumption after the conclusion of the evidence.\nUltimately, the court ruled on the standing issue without conducting an evidentiary hearing on the issue. The record indicates that the issue of whether Jennifer was a willing and able parent was not actually tried. The court denied the request for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether Jennifer was a willing and able parent and then proceeded to what was ostensibly a dispositional hearing on best interests. Thus, the parties were not on notice that the issue of standing was being considered by the court, and any evidence introduced on the issue was merely coincidental. Alternatively, the court’s action could be characterized as misinterpreting the test for best interests. Either way, the issue of standing was never tried.\nThe interpretation of comparable statutory schemes for determining custody supports a reversal. Under other statutory schemes, the fitness of a parent and the best interests of a child are seen as distinct matters, and courts have recognized the potential for prejudice and confusion when the issues are not addressed at separate hearings. In re Adoption of Syck, 138 Ill. 2d 255, 276, 562 N.E.2d 174, 184 (1990); In re C.L.T., 302 Ill. App. 3d 770, 779, 706 N.E.2d 123, 129 (1999) (Adoption Act (750 ILCS 50/1 (West 1996))); In re M.B., 332 Ill. App. 3d 996, 1004, 773 N.E.2d 1204, 1210 (2002) (Juvenile Court Act of 1987 (705 ILCS 405/2 — 3 (West 2000))). This court need not address whether it is possible for the separate issues of standing and best interests in the Probate Act to be considered at a consolidated proceeding. See Freeman v. Settle, 75 Ill. App. 3d 799, 804, 393 N.E.2d 1385, 1388 (1979) (the record indicated that the court and the parties clearly understood their responsibilities at a single hearing under the Adoption Act); see also In re Custody of Gonzalez, 204 Ill. App. 3d 28, 31-32, 561 N.E.2d 1276, 1278 (1990) (a waiver of the standing requirement in a custody case under the Marriage Act). At best, the proceedings in this case are so muddled that they leave the factual underpinnings of the court’s decision unreliable.\nJennifer contends that Victor waived his right to appeal a lack of an evidentiary hearing on the standing issue. Victor did not object to the lack of a hearing on the standing issue. Indeed, Jennifer points out that Victor was perfectly happy with the trial court’s prehearing ruling.\nThis, however, misconstrues why the proceedings were flawed. Victor had no reason to call for an evidentiary hearing on the standing issue, or even present evidence on the issue, because the trial court indicated that he had already been granted standing. Although Jennifer is able to point to comments by the trial court at the conclusion of the hearing referring to paragraph (b), the undeniable import of the trial court’s prehearing comments was that the ostensible purpose of the hearing was the question of best interests, not standing. Thus, the trial court’s conclusory ruling and posthearing comments defy application of the standard of review this court would apply if the issue had actually been tried. See In re Guardianship of K.R.J., 405 Ill. App. 3d 527, 535-36 (2010) (describing the mixed standard of review applied when standing is tried).\nThe nature of the standing requirement as a protection for parents, instead of petitioners, does not diminish the magnitude of the trial court’s error. The application of a standard for which there was no evidentiary hearing and the revival of a presumption that the court indicated had been overcome mandate a remand for an actual evidentiary hearing on the standing issue.\nThe comments of the trial court that Jennifer relies on for her claim of waiver raise other issues. Jennifer notes that the trial court referred to paragraph (b) after the conclusion of the evidence. The court stated that the Probate Act limited its consideration to acts of commission and excluded acts of omission as evidence. The Probate Act makes no such distinction.\nThe trial court also commented that the role of the guardian ad litem was limited to issues concerning the best interests of the minor. In denying the request for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of standing, the trial court suggested that the guardian ad litem would be precluded from commenting on whether Jennifer was a willing-and-able parent. Again, there is no basis for this limitation. The court had plenary jurisdiction over the person of the minor, and the authority to appoint the guardian ad litem was derived from common law. In re Estate of Green, 359 Ill. App. 3d 730, 737, 835 N.E.2d 403, 409 (2005).\nCONCLUSION\nAccordingly, the order of the circuit court of Jackson County is hereby reversed, and the matter is remanded with directions to conduct an evidentiary hearing on standing as described in the Probate Act (755 ILCS 5/11 — 5 (West 2008)).\nReversed; cause remanded with directions.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

He maintains he is entitled to a new trial based on the prosecutor’s closing argument; the trial court’s alleged failure to comply with Supreme Court Rule 431(b) (Ill. S. Ct. R. 431(b) (eff. May 1, 2007)); and the trial court’s allegedly improper admission of defendant’s two prior convictions. Defendant further claims the trial court unconstitutionally enhanced his sentence under section 5—5—3(c)(8) of the Unified Code of Corrections (730 ILCS 5/5—5—3(c)(8) (West 2008)), warranting a resentencing. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\nBACKGROUND\nDefendant was arrested for burglary on June 28, 2007, shortly after 1:30 a.m. He took a decoy purse from an unmarked police car. Defendant testified at trial that he took the purse, as well as a carton of cigarettes and a bottle, from the car, believing they belonged to “Slim,” someone he knew. Slim allegedly directed defendant to take the items out of the car and watch them while Slim ran into a liquor store that was about to close. Defendant was arrested when he started to cross the street, allegedly intending to merely sit at the bus stop across the street and wait for Slim.\nThe State called three witnesses. Officer Brian Rodriguez testified that he was part of the burglary investigation on June 28, 2007, that led to defendant’s arrest. The area at which defendant was arrested allegedly had an ongoing problem of thefts from cars. Officer Rodriguez’s role was to watch the decoy purse that had been placed on the passenger seat of the unmarked police car. The car was approximately 45 to 50 feet away from him, with its windows completely open. Defendant allegedly approached the car, looked inside, backed up, and turned his head from side to side. He then approached the car a second time and removed the purse through the passenger window. Officer Rodriguez did not see defendant talking to anyone nor did he notice anyone around him. Defendant then allegedly placed the purse under his arm and walked away from the car, crossing the street. Officer Rodriguez radioed other officers and described defendant, who was then arrested.\nOfficer Billy Todde, another member of the investigation team, testified that he parked the unmarked car at the scene, placed the decoy purse on the front seat, lowered the windows, and walked away. He then entered another unmarked car to await further instructions from Officer Rodriguez. After being notified that defendant had taken the purse, Officer Todde returned to the scene and stopped defendant in the middle of the street, about 30 feet from the car. He found the purse in defendant’s possession and arrested him.\nOfficer Mark Schlink, the State’s rebuttal witness, affirmed Officer Todde’s testimony and added that defendant was carrying only the decoy purse and nothing else. The State also offered, in rebuttal, certified copies of defendant’s two misdemeanor retail theft convictions from May 20, 1999, and May 17, 1999 (People’s Exhibits 2 and 3). The trial court admitted those convictions, but barred the introduction of defendant’s two other misdemeanor theft convictions from 1998 and 1999, finding that the prejudicial impact outweighed the probative value. Defendant’s convictions were admitted solely to impeach his testimony. Nonetheless, the prosecutor argued in closing that: “The defendant is a thief, and you know he’s a thief because of People’s Exhibit No. 2 and People’s Exhibit No. 3.” Defendant did not object. The trial court later instructed the jurors:\n“Any evidence that was received for a limited purpose should not be considered by you for any other purpose. You should disregard testimony and exhibits which the Court has refused or stricken.\nThe evidence which you should consider consists only of the testimony of the witnesses and the exhibits which the Court has received.\n❖ ❖ ❖\nOpening statements are made by the attorneys to acquaint you with the facts they expect to prove. Closing arguments are made by the attorneys to discuss the facts and circumstances in the case and they should be confined to the evidence and to reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.\nNeither opening statements nor closing arguments are evidence, as we talked about earlier, and any statement or argument made by the lawyers which is not based on any of the evidence should be disregarded.\n% ❖ #\nEvidence of defendant’s previous conviction of any offense may be considered by you only as it may effect his believability as a witnesses and must not be considered by you as evidence of his guilt of the offense which is he is charged.”\nThe jury returned a guilty verdict. Defendant then filed a motion for acquittal and a new trial, arguing that the State had not sustained its burden and that his prior convictions were inadmissible. The motion was denied.\nAt sentencing, the trial court inquired whether the parties wished to amend defendant’s presentencing investigation report (PSI). Defendant declined to do so, and the State corrected two convictions, without any objection. The State then argued in aggravation that a mandatory Class X sentence should be imposed because defendant allegedly had “[a] 1991 conviction for possession for a controlled substance with intent to deliver, which was a class 1. And there is a 1999 conviction for delivery of a controlled substance, which was also a class 1.” Although the PSI shows that defendant was convicted for delivery of a controlled substance in 1990, not 1999, defendant’s counsel, who argued in mitigation, did not object to the prosecutor’s statement or attempt to correct it.\nThe trial court imposed a Class X sentence, finding:\n“In taking into account, there [are] a lot of misdemeanor convictions in the defendant’s history, and its true that he does have five prior felony convictions, the last of which was in, was from a 1990 case, later in 1991, so some 17 years before this case occurred. So I’m taking all of those factors into consideration.\nBased upon the defendant’s background, I find he is subject to mandatory class X sentencing, based upon the two convictions highlighted by the State. I’ll sentence the defendant to six years, the minimum sentence under the law, in the Illinois Department of Corrections.”\nDefendant did not object to the sentence nor did he file a postsentencing motion. He nevertheless maintains his sentence was unconstitutionally enhanced, that the trial court erred in admitting his two prior theft convictions, and that it failed to comply with Rule 431(b).\nANALYSIS\nA. Defendant Has Forfeited His Rule 431(b) Claim\n• 1 Amended Supreme Court Rule 431(b) mandates:\n“The court shall ask each potential juror, individually or in a group, whether that juror understands and accepts the following principles: (1) that the defendant is presumed innocent of the charge(s) against him or her; (2) that before a defendant can be convicted the State must prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) that the defendant is not required to offer any evidence on his or her own behalf; and (4) that the defendant’s failure to testify cannot be held against him or her; however, no inquiry of a prospective juror shall be made into the defendant’s failure to testify when the defendant objects.\nThe court’s method of inquiry shall provide each juror an opportunity to respond to specific questions concerning the principles set out in this section.” Ill. S. Ct. R. 431(b) (eff. May 1, 2007).\nAs recently explained by our supreme court:\n“The language of Rule 431(b) is clear and unambiguous. The rule states that the trial court ‘shall ask’ potential jurors whether they understand and accept the enumerated principles. While the prospective jurors may be questioned individually or in a group, the method of inquiry must ‘provide each juror an opportunity to respond to specific questions concerning the Rule 431(b) principles.’ The committee comments emphasize that trial courts may not simply give ‘a broad statement of the applicable law followed by a general question concerning the juror’s willingness to follow the law.’ 177 Ill. 2d R. 431, Committee Comments.\nRule 431(b), therefore, mandates a specific question and response process. The trial court must ask each potential juror whether he or she understands and accepts each of the principles in the rule. The questioning may be performed either individually or in a group, but the rule requires an opportunity for a response from each prospective juror on their understanding and acceptance of those principles.” People v. Thompson, 238 Ill. 2d 598, 607 (2010).\nHere, the trial court instructed the jurors:\n“Under our law, a defendant is presumed to he innocent of the charge placed against him. The presumption of innocence stays with the defendant throughout the whole trial even during your deliberations on the verdict and it’s not overcome unless from looking at all of the evidence in the case you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty.\nThe defendant is not required to prove his innocence and that means the defendant does not have to call any witnesses, the defendant himself does not have to testify, that’s true in this case and in every criminal case across the country. The reason for that is it’s the State’s burden of proving somebody guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by themselves. The defendant does not have to put on any evidence at all.”\nThe court continued:\n“As I just stated a couple of minutes ago, the defendant in this case just like every criminal case across our country is presumed to be innocent of the charge against him, and what that means is that he doesn’t have to put any evidence forward on his own behalf, he must be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by the State. Raise your hand if you don’t understand that. Nobody is raising your hand as I expected — I’m sorry, you are raising your hand. What is your name, ma’am.\nPROSPECTIVE JUROR: Essie Bowman.\nTHE COURT: Okay.\nPROSPECTIVE JUROR: I hear everything you are saying but I don’t pick all that, I have special need, people help me when I—\nTHE COURT: Ms. Bowman, what I’m going to ask the attorneys to do is write down your name so if you happen to be any of the people that we talk to individually, Ms. Bowman, I will talk to you more fully about that, okay.\nPROSPECTIVE JUROR: Okay.\nTHE COURT: There are no other hands raised. Other than Ms. Bowman, is there anybody here even though you understand, anybody here who has some fundamental problem with that cornerstone of our criminal justice system?\n(No response.)\nTHE COURT: Nobody is raising their hand.”\nThe trial court sufficiently complied with Rule 431(b) with respect to the State’s burden of proof, defendant’s evidentiary burden, and the presumption of innocence. Defendant disagrees, arguing that the trial court’s inquiry improperly “blurred the distinction between the individuals principles and did not afford the prospective jurors an adequate opportunity to express doubt or bias about the individual concepts.” This argument fails. We have already held that Rule 431(b)\n“does not identify or dictate a particular methodology for establishing the understanding or acceptance of the venire as to those principles.\nImportantly, the rule speaks of ‘principles’ instead of questions. Likewise, the rule does not set out these principles in the form of questions to be posed in haec verba. Nor does the rule provide for any ‘magic words’ or ‘catechism’ in order to satisfy its mandate.” People v. Vargas, 396 Ill. App. 3d 465, 472 (2009).\nPeople v. Digby, 405 Ill. App. 3d 544, 548 (2010) (“Rule 431(b) does not dictate a particular methodology for establishing the venire’s understanding or acceptance of those principles.”). The trial court sufficiently inquired whether the potential jurors understood and accepted the State’s burden of proof, defendant’s evidentiary burden, and the presumption of innocence.\nAs for the fourth principle in Rule 431(b), the trial court instructed the jurors:\n“[Defendant doesn’t have to present any evidence, that means he doesn’t have to testify on his own behalf. If the defendant decides not to testify on his own behalf, that’s one of his rights, guaranteed to him as a citizen of this country and you must not and cannot hold it against him. Is there anybody here who couldn’t follow the law in that regard?\n(No response.)\nTHE COURT: Nobody is raising their hand.”\nWhile this was sufficient to determine whether the jurors accepted defendant’s right not to testify, it did not ask whether the potential jurors understood that right. This inquiry does not satisfy Rule 431(b). Defendant did not, however, raise this issue in the trial court. Although that would generally waive the alleged error on appeal (People v. Enoch, 122 Ill. 2d 176, 186 (1988) (“failure to raise an issue in a written motion for a new trial results in a waiver of that issue on appeal”)), defendant claims Rule 431(b) objections may not be waived or, alternatively, application of the waiver rule should be relaxed for Rule 431(b) claims. Our supreme court recently rejected both arguments, however, stating:\n“To preserve a claim for review, a defendant must both object at trial and include the alleged error in a written posttrial motion. [Citation.] Here, defendant did not object to the trial court’s failure to comply with Rule 431(b) or include that issue in his posttrial motion. Accordingly, we agree that defendant has forfeited appellate review of his claim.\nIn support of his argument on relaxing the forfeiture rule, defendant raises what this court has termed the ‘Sprinkle doctrine.’ We recently explained that under the Sprinkle doctrine, the forfeiture rule may be relaxed when a trial judge oversteps his or her authority in the presence of the jury or when counsel has been effectively prevented from objecting because it would have ‘ “fallen on deaf ears.” ’ People v. Hanson, 238 Ill. 2d 74, 118 (2010), quoting McLaurin, 235 Ill. 2d at 488. The failure to preserve an error will be excused under the Sprinkle doctrine only in extraordinary circumstances, however, such as when a judge makes inappropriate remarks to a jury or relies on social commentary instead of evidence in imposing a death sentence. [Citations.] We have stressed the importance of applying the forfeiture rule uniformly except in compelling situations because failure to raise a claim properly denies the trial court an opportunity to correct an error or grant a new trial, thus wasting time and judicial resources. [Citation.]\nIn this case, there is no indication that the trial court would have ignored an objection to the Rule 431(b) questioning. We presume that the trial court would have complied with the mandatory language of Supreme Court Rule 431(b) had the error been pointed out at trial. Moreover, defendant does not argue that the trial court overstepped its authority in the jury’s presence. A simple objection would have allowed the trial court to correct the error during voir dire. Accordingly, we conclude there is no compelling reason to relax the forfeiture rule in this case.” Thompson, 238 Ill. 2d at 611-12.\nThe same result is warranted here. Defendant has not demonstrated that his objection would have been disregarded by the court nor has he established any other compelling reason for relaxing the forfeiture rule.\nWhere, as in this case, “the defendant fails to make a timely objection and therefore forfeits review, the reviewing court will [nonetheless] examine the record only for plain error.” People v. McLaurin, 235 Ill. 2d 478, 495 (2009). “Plain error is a narrow and limited exception to the general waiver rule.” People v. Pastorino, 91 Ill. 2d 178, 188 (1982). It applies only\n“when (1) a clear or obvious error occurred and the evidence is so closely balanced that the error alone threatened to tip the scales of justice against the defendant, regardless of the seriousness of the error, or (2) a clear or obvious error occurred and that error is so serious that it affected the fairness of the defendant’s trial and challenged the integrity of the judicial process, regardless of the closeness of the evidence.” People v. Piatkowski, 225 Ill. 2d 551, 565 (2007).\n“In a plain-error review, the burden of persuasion remains on the defendant.” McLaurin, 235 Ill. 2d at 495.\nDefendant claims both prongs of plain-error review. The first prong applies “where the evidence in a case is so closely balanced that the jury’s guilty verdict may have resulted from the error and not the evidence.” People v. Herron, 215 Ill. 2d 167, 178 (2005). The court must “consider whether the outcome of defendant’s trial may have been affected by the trial court’s failure to ask potential jurors if they *** understood that defendant had the right not to testify ***. The defendant must establish that the error alone could have led to his conviction.” (Emphasis added.) People v. Willis, 402 Ill. App. 3d 47, 54 (2010). That has not been done here. Even if the evidence was closely balanced, the trial court’s failure to inquire whether the potential jurors understood defendant’s right not to testify was of no consequence since defendant testified at trial and the trial court instructed the potential jurors of defendant’s right not to testify. No plain error occurred under the first prong of review.\nWith respect to the second prong, defendant claims the trial court’s error deprived him of a fair trial by an impartial jury. Defendant has not provided any evidence, however, demonstrating that the jury was biased. As recently clarified by our supreme court, mere violation of Rule 431(b) does not render a jury biased nor warrant automatic reversal under the second prong of plain-error review:\n“A finding that defendant was tried by a biased jury would certainly satisfy the second prong of plain-error review because it would affect his right to a fair trial and challenge the integrity of the judicial process. Critically, however, defendant has not presented any evidence that the jury was biased in this case. Defendant has the burden of persuasion on this issue. We cannot presume the jury was biased simply because the trial court erred in conducting the Rule 431(b) questioning.\nOur amendment to Rule 431(b) does not indicate that compliance with the rule is now indispensable to a fair trial. As we have explained, the failure to conduct Rule 431(b) questioning does not necessarily result in a biased jury, regardless of whether that questioning is mandatory or permissive under our rule. Although the amendment to the rule serves to promote the selection of an impartial jury by making questioning mandatory, Rule 431(b) questioning is only one method of helping to ensure the selection of an impartial jury. [Citation.] It is not the only means of achieving that objective. A violation of Rule 431(b) does not implicate a fundamental right or constitutional protection, but only involves a violation of this court’s rules. [Citation.] Despite our amendment to the rule, we cannot conclude that Rule 431(b) questioning is indispensable to the selection of an impartial jury.” Thompson, 238 Ill. 2d at 614-15.\nSince there is no evidence here that defendant’s jury was biased, the second prong of plain-error review is inapplicable. Defendant has forfeited his Rule 431(b) claim.\nB. Defendant’s Two Prior Theft Convictions Were Properly Admitted\n•2 “A trial court’s ruling on the admissibility of other-crimes evidence will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. [Citations.] An abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court’s ruling is arbitrary, fanciful or where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the trial court.” People v. Childress, 338 Ill. App. 3d 540, 545 (2003). Defendant maintains here that the trial court erroneously admitted his two prior misdemeanor theft convictions.\n“Evidence of prior convictions is admissible for impeachment purposes if (1) the witness’s crime was punishable by death or by imprisonment for more than one year, or the crime involved dishonesty or false statement regardless of the punishment; (2) the witness’s conviction or release from confinement, whichever date is later, occurred less than 10 years before the date of trial; and (3) the danger of unfair prejudice does not substantially outweigh the probative value of the conviction.” People v. Whirl, 351 Ill. App. 3d 464, 466-67 (2004).\nDefendant claims his two convictions were of minimal probative value and were highly prejudicial, that the trial court failed to sufficiently weigh the age of the convictions, and that the trial court overlooked defendant’s productive lifestyle since 1999.\n“Trial judges are given factors to use when conducting the balancing test — an exercise in discretion. These include the nature of the prior conviction, its recency and similarity to the present charge, other circumstances surrounding the prior conviction, and the length of the witness’s criminal record. [Citation.] Convictions of the same crime for which the defendant is on trial should be admitted ‘sparingly.’ [Citation.] However, the supreme court found no error where the trial judge in a burglary case allowed the defendant to be impeached with two prior burglary convictions.” Stokes v. City of Chicago, 333 Ill. App. 3d 272, 279-80 (2002).\n“The trial court has discretion in the balancing test and in determining whether a prior conviction is admissible. [Citation.] However, the trial court should not apply the balancing test mechanically [citation], and the record must include some indication that the trial court was aware of its discretion to exclude a prior conviction [citation].” Whirl,\n351 Ill. App. 3d at 467. The trial court need not articulate all the factors considered in its application of the balancing test. People v. Atkinson, 186 Ill. 2d 450, 462-63 (1999). The record here clearly reveals that the trial court was aware of its discretion and exercised it:\n“I understand the arguments of both of the parties and I think that there is always a careful balancing test to be performed when admitting proof of other crimes. In this case, certainly the defendant is charged with burglary and the element is did he intend to commit a theft, so certainly it is somewhat prejudicial that the defendant’s five prior felony convictions that fall within the scope of Montgomery are all thefts.\nOn the other hand, that has to be balanced against the defendant’s testimony and his credibility. I think in this case, weighing the probative value versus the prejudicial effect, I find that it is relevant for the jurors to take into account the convictions listed under A and B, those two retail thefts. I think that suffices, for purposes of allowing the jurors an opportunity to evaluate the defendant’s credibility in light of his background.\nWith respect to misdemeanors that you list in C, D and E which are again all thefts from ’98 and ’99, I’m not going to allow those to come into evidence. I think that would be too prejudicial to let in five of them. I think they are going to be able to weigh his credibility sufficiently with two of the eligible five misdemeanor convictions. So that will be my ruling on that.”\nRather than “verbal homage” to the balancing test, the trial court’s ruling demonstrates reasoned application. While defendant’s convictions were not recent, it cannot be said on the record sub judice that the trial court applied the balancing test improperly. That others may have reached a different result does not render the trial court’s decision erroneous. People v. Chapman, 262 Ill. App. 3d 439, 461 (1992) (“A reviewing court may not simply substitute its judgment for that of the trial court on a matter within the trial court’s discretion.”). The trial court did not abuse its discretion.\nC. The Prosecutor’s Closing Arguments, Though Improper, Were Not Substantially Prejudicial\n•3 “It is well established that prosecutors are afforded wide latitude in closing argument, and improper remarks will not merit reversal unless they result in substantial prejudice to the defendant. [Citation.] In reviewing allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, the closing arguments of both the State and the defendant must be examined in their entirety, and the complained-of remarks must be placed in their proper context.” People v. Kitchen, 159 Ill. 2d 1, 38-39 (1994).\nHere, the prosecutor argued in closing:\n“Your verdict should be based on evidence and the evidence in this case comes from the witnesses’ testimony and the evidence in this case comes from the exhibits that have been entered. The defendant is a thief, and you know he’s a thief because of People’s Exhibit No. 2 and People’s Exhibit No. 3 [defendant’s prior convictions]. The defendant paints a nice picture of himself not doing anything wrong but that doesn’t mean that he wasn’t doing anything wrong.”\nThis argument was clearly improper and contrary to the law governing admission of prior convictions. People v. Williams, 161 Ill. 2d 1, 39-40 (1994) (“It is a fundamental tenet of our criminal justice system *** that the introduction of evidence of other crimes to show or suggest a propensity to commit crime is an improper purpose and is prohibited.”). While we do not in any way condone the prosecutor’s argument, defendant waived the issue by failing to object during closing or through a posttrial motion. “Generally, failure to object to any impropriety in counsel’s closing argument results in waiver unless comments are so inflammatory and prejudicial that [defendant] is denied a fair trial.” Limanowski v. Ashland Oil Co., 275 Ill. App. 3d 115, 118 (1995).\n“In reviewing comments made at closing arguments, this court asks whether or not the comments engender substantial prejudice against a defendant such that it is impossible to say whether or not a verdict of guilt resulted from them. [Citation.] Misconduct in closing argument is substantial and warrants reversal and a new trial if the improper remarks constituted a material factor in a defendant’s conviction. [Citation.] If the jury could have reached a contrary verdict had the improper remarks not been made, or the reviewing court cannot say that the prosecutor’s improper remarks did not contribute to the defendant’s conviction, a new trial should be granted.” People v. Wheeler, 226 Ill. 2d 92, 123 (2007).\nWe are not persuaded on the record sub judice that counsel’s comment was so improper or so prejudicial as to warrant a new trial, particularly in light of the trial court’s subsequent admonishment to the jury that:\n“Any evidence that was received for a limited purpose should not be considered by you for any other purpose. You should disregard testimony and exhibits which the Court has refused or stricken.\nThe evidence which you should consider consists only of the testimony of the witnesses and the exhibits which the Court has received.\nS¡t ifc s¡t\nOpening statements are made by the attorneys to acquaint you with the facts they expect to prove. Closing arguments are made by the attorneys to discuss the facts and circumstances in the case and they should be confined to the evidence and to reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.\nNeither opening statements nor closing arguments are evidence, as we talked about earlier, and any statement or argument made by the lawyers which is not based on any of the evidence should be disregarded.\n$ ^ ^\nEvidence of defendant’s previous conviction of any offense may be considered by you only as it may effect his believability as a witnesses and must not be considered by you as evidence of his guilt of the offense which is he is charged.”\nWe are not persuaded that defendant was denied a fair trial.\nDefendant maintains reversal is nonetheless warranted because the underlying evidence here was closely balanced. Again, plain-error review may be invoked where “a clear or obvious error occurred and the evidence is so closely balanced that the error alone threatened to tip the scales of justice against the defendant, regardless of the seriousness of the error.” Piatkowski, 225 Ill. 2d at 565. The evidence here was not, however, closely balanced. While defendant and the police officers called by the State provided competing versions of the events, the State also introduced two of defendant’s prior convictions to impeach defendant’s testimony credibility. We are not convinced the prosecutor’s isolated misstatement during closing may have led to the jury’s verdict. Plain-error review is inapplicable.\nD. Defendant’s Sentence Is Affirmed\n•4 Defendant argues that the trial court unconstitutionally imposed a Class X sentence under section 5—5—3(c)(8) of the Unified Code of Corrections (730 ILCS 5/5—5—3(c)(8) (West 2008)) because the State did not prove the statutory elements therein beyond a reasonable doubt and the trial court impermissibly relied on defendant’s presentencing investigation report (PSI) to determine the timing of defendant’s prior crimes and convictions. “To be sentenced under the Class X provision, a defendant must have previously been twice convicted of a Class 2 or greater class felony, and the commission and conviction dates of the prior felonies must have occurred in the chronological order mandated by the statute.” People v. Williams, 149 Ill. 2d 467, 473 (1992). Section 5—5—3(c)(8) mandates, in relevant part:\n“When a defendant, over the age of 21 years, is convicted of a Class 1 or a Class 2 felony, after having twice been convicted in any state or federal court of an offense that contains the same elements as an offense now classified in Illinois as a Class 2 or greater Class felony and such charges are separately brought and tried and arise out of different series of acts, such defendant shall be sentenced as a Class X offender. This paragraph shall not apply unless (1) the first felony was committed after the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1977; and (2) the second felony was committed after conviction of the first; and (3) the third felony was committed after conviction of the second.” 730 ILCS 5/5—5—3(c)(8) (West 2008).\nDefendant claims his sentence was unconstitutionally enhanced because the State failed to establish the timing of his prior offenses beyond a reasonable doubt and that it is “constitutionally insufficient for a sentencing judge to rely on lesser evidence — such as a PSI drafted by the Adult Probation Department — when determining the existence of sentence-enhancing facts.” The State responds, inter alia, that defendant has forfeited this issue because he did not object or file a postsentencing motion.\nDefendant “may challenge the constitutionality of a statute at any time.” People v. Wagener, 196 Ill. 2d 269, 279 (2001). We have already held, however, subsequent to Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 16-26 (2005), that section 5—5—3(c)(8) is not unconstitutional and that the factors thereunder need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. People v. Yancy, 368 Ill. App. 3d 381, 393 (2005); accord People v. Matthews, 362 Ill. App. 3d 953 (2005), appeal denied, 219 Ill. 2d 583 (2006); People v. Rivera, 362 Ill. App. 3d 815 (2005), appeal denied, 218 Ill. 2d 553 (2006). Moreover, a trial court may rely on a PSI to impose a Class X sentence. Rivera, 362 Ill. App. 3d at 821 (“a presentence report, like the one in the instant case, is generally a reliable source for the purpose of inquiring into a defendant’s criminal history”); Yancy, 368 Ill. App. 3d at 393 (holding that “in finding that an enhanced sentence was warranted, the sentencing court was entitled to rely on evidence *** in defendant’s PSI”). Here, defendant’s PSI shows two felony drug convictions: February 9, 1990, and February 14, 1991. Defendant’s Illinois State Police criminal history record, included as part of the PSI, shows that the second offense occurred on August 2, 1990. Defendant’s Class X sentence is affirmed.\nCONCLUSION\nWe affirm defendant’s conviction and sentence. Although the trial court did not fully comply with Rule 431(b), defendant forfeited that issue by failing to timely object, and plain-error review is inapplicable. The trial court did not err in admitting defendant’s two prior theft convictions, and the prosecutor’s closing arguments, though improper, were not so prejudicial as to warrant a new trial.\nAffirmed.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

Post, Assistant Attorney General, of counsel), for other respondents.&#39;], &#39;opinions&#39;: [{&#39;author&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE McLAREN&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE McLAREN\ndelivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\nJustices Zenoff and Burke concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nOPINION\nPetitioner, the City of Sandwich (the City), petitions for review of the certification of representation and the decision and order of respondent Illinois Labor Relations Board, State Panel (Board), certifying respondent Illinois Fraternal Order of Police Labor Council (FOP) as the exclusive representative for collective bargaining purposes of all full-time sworn police officers of the rank of sergeant and below employed by the City. We reverse the decision and order and vacate the certification of representation.\nIn October 2008, the FOP filed a petition with the Board, seeking to include City police officers with the rank of sergeant in its bargaining unit of police officers below the rank of sergeant. The City filed a response and a motion to dismiss, arguing that sergeants are supervisors pursuant to section 3(r) of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act (Act) (5 ILCS 315/3(r) (West 2008)) and that the City did not agree, pursuant to sections 3(s)(1) and (s)(2) of the Act (5 ILCS 315/3(s)(1), (s)(2) (West 2008)), to certify for collective bargaining purposes a unit consisting of both supervisors and nonsupervisors. An administrative law judge denied the City’s motion to dismiss and ultimately ordered a hearing. On March 31, 2009, after a hearing, the administrative law judge issued a recommended decision and order, concluding that sergeants are not supervisors within the meaning of the Act and ordering a secret ballot election to be conducted among the City’s sergeants. The City filed an exception to the recommended decision and order with the Board, which subsequently found that the City’s sergeants are “public employees within the meaning of the Act” and ordered a representation election.\nWe first must address this court’s jurisdiction over this matter. The parties agree that the petition for review in case No. 2—09— 0800, which was filed after the Board’s decision was entered but before the representation election was held, was untimely. See Chief Judge of the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit v. Illinois State Labor Relations Board, 275 Ill. App. 3d 853, 856 (1995) (“An order by the Board certifying a labor organization as the exclusive bargaining representative of employees in the bargaining unit is a final order that is reviewable directly by this court.”); City of Wood Dale v. Illinois State Labor Relations Board, 166 Ill. App. 3d 881, 887 (1988) (the unit-recognition process is “not complete until certification after an election”). Therefore we lack jurisdiction in appeal No. 2 — 09—0800, and we dismiss that appeal. However, the City timely filed its petition for review in case No. 2 — 09—0985 after the Board-ordered election, and we have jurisdiction over that appeal.\nThe City contends that the Board erred in finding that the City’s sergeants are not supervisors pursuant to the Act. On administrative review of an agency decision, our review extends to all questions of fact and law presented in the record. City of Freeport v. Illinois State Labor Relations Board, 135 Ill. 2d 499, 516 (1990). A reviewing court may not rubber-stamp an administrative decision that it deems inconsistent with the statutory mandate or that frustrates the policy underlying the statute. City of Freeport, 135 Ill. 2d at 516.\nThis court may apply three standards of review when reviewing an agency’s decision. On questions of fact, we deem the agency’s findings and conclusions to be prima facie true and correct, and we will overturn such findings only if they are against the manifest weight of the evidence. Cinkus v. Village of Stickney Municipal Officers Electoral Board, 228 Ill. 2d 200, 210 (2008). A determination is against the manifest weight of the evidence if the opposite conclusion is clearly evident. Cinkus, 228 Ill. 2d at 210. Questions of law we review de novo, granting no deference to the agency. See Cinkus, 228 Ill. 2d at 210-11. Mixed questions of law and fact (where historical facts are established or undisputed, and the issue is whether those facts satisfy the statutory standard) are examined with a standard of review of clearly erroneous. Cinkus, 228 Ill. 2d at 211. An agency’s decision is “clearly erroneous” when the reviewing court is left with a firm and definite conviction that the agency has committed a mistake. Cinkus, 228 Ill. 2d at 211.\nSection 3(r) of the Act provides in relevant part:\n“ ‘Supervisor’ is an employee whose principal work is substantially different from that of his or her subordinates and who has authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, direct, reward, or discipline employees, to adjust their grievances, or to effectively recommend any of those actions, if the exercise of that authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the consistent use of independent judgment. Except with respect to police employment, the term ‘supervisor’ includes only those individuals who devote a preponderance of their employment time to exercising that authority, State supervisors notwithstanding. In addition, in determining supervisory status in police employment, rank shall not be determinative. The Board shall consider, as evidence of bargaining unit inclusion or exclusion, the common law enforcement policies and relationships between police officer ranks and certification under applicable civil service law, ordinances, personnel codes, or Division 2.1 of Article 10 of the Illinois Municipal Code, but these factors shall not be the sole or predominant factors considered by the Board in determining police supervisory status.” 5 ILCS 315/ 3(r) (West 2008).\nA police officer meets the definition of supervisor contained in section 3(r) if he: (1) performs principal work substantially different from that of his subordinates; (2) has the authority in the interest of his employer to perform at least 1 of the 11 enumerated supervisory functions or to effectively recommend such action; and (3) consistently uses independent judgment in performing or recommending the enumerated actions. City of Freeport, 135 Ill. 2d at 505-06; Village of Hazel Crest v. Ulinois Labor Relations Board, 385 Ill. App. 3d 109, 114 (2008). The existence of even one indicium of supervisory authority accompanied by independent judgment is sufficient to support a finding of supervisory status. Village of Hazel Crest, 385 Ill. App. 3d at 114.\nHere, the parties stipulated, and the Board found, that the sergeants perform principal work substantially different from that of peace officers with the rank of patrol officers. However, the Board found that the sergeants “do not possess the authority to perform any of the statutory indicia with the requisite independent judgment.” Thus, the Board found the sergeants to be public employees within the meaning of the Act, and it ordered a representation election.\nGENERAL BACKGROUND\nAt the hearing before the administrative law judge, Chief Richard Olson testified about the policies, procedures, and operations of the Sandwich police department. The department has 17 full-time police officers: the chief, 3 sergeants, and 13 patrol officers. The department also employs civilians as dispatchers, crossing guards, and records clerks. There is no other supervisory rank besides chief and sergeant. All officers other than chief are considered to be in the patrol division. The patrol division has three shifts: 6 a.m. to 4 p.m., 3 p.m. to 1 a.m., and 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. Olson was normally scheduled to work approximately 45 hours a week, during the 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. shift, 5 days a week. However, “realistically” he worked closer to 55 hours per week. When he was not at the department office, a sergeant was the highest-ranking officer.\nThe sergeant was in charge of his shift. If no sergeant was present, for example because of vacation or sick leave, the senior patrol officer would run the shift. However, another sergeant would be on call in the event that something serious occurred. The chief was not on the on-call list. One sergeant was always in charge of each shift, whether at the department or on call.\nThe City also introduced into evidence several ordinances and policies. Section 42 — 36 of the Sandwich Municipal Code, which created the position of sergeant of police, states in part:\n“(b) Duties\n(1) A sergeant shall be responsible for the activities of the patrol officer on his assigned shift. The sergeant shall supervise the activities of his shift, seeing that the patrol officer:\na. Knows his zones of responsibility and patrols his zones.\nb. Responds to calls for service promptly.\nc. Completes all investigations promptly.\nd. Collects and preserves evidence properly.\ne. Makes proper arrests, searches and seizures.\nf. Processes prisoners properly.\ng. Signs and completes all reports properly.\nh. Knows and understands the law.\ni. Knows and understands the rules, regulations and orders of the police department.\nj. Knows and understands the proper enforcement of the laws.\n(2) In addition to his supervisory duties, a sergeant shall:\n* s}c *\nc. Investigate complaints against a patrol officer on his shift and make a written report to the chief.” Sandwich Municipal Code ch. 42, §§42 — 36(b)(1), (b)(2)(c).\nDepartment policy No. 102.2, “Police Sergeant Job Description,” states:\n“The work in this class involves the function of a shift supervisor. In this capacity, the primary responsibility is to provide direct day-to-day supervision of uniformed officers and telecommunica tors assigned to a particular shift. The patrol Sergeant is also required to maintain the general patrol officer duties to augment the tasks of their assigned shift.”\nPolicy No. 103.4 defines “Supervisor” as “any rank above patrolman.”\nSergeant Joseph Spartz testified that Chief Olson was “in charge” 33% of the time. As one sergeant was currently on disability, sergeants were in charge 36% of the time and patrol officers were in charge 32% of the time. Spartz stated that he had issued verbal reprimands to patrol officers but that he did not document them if the behavior was corrected immediately. When he investigated a citizen complaint against a patrol officer or recommended some type of disciplinary action, he forwarded his report or recommendation to the chief, who made the decision. Olson did not always carry out Spartz’s suggestions or requests.\nBoth Olson and Spartz also discussed several instances involving recommended disciplinary actions against patrol officers. Ultimately, Olson decided on the action to be taken. Sometimes the discipline was harsher than that recommended by the sergeant; sometimes, it was more lenient. Other times, Olson followed the recommendation.\nANALYSIS\nWe first note that nowhere in its written decision and order did the Board even mention, let alone address, the City ordinance and department policies regarding the supervisory role of the sergeants. Pursuant to section 3(r) of the Act, the Board “shall consider, as evidence of bargaining unit inclusion or exclusion, the common law enforcement policies and relationships between police officer ranks and certification under applicable *** ordinances, [and] personnel codes.” (Emphasis added.) 5 ILCS 315/3(r) (West 2008). While these factors “shall not be the sole or predominant factors considered by the Board in determining police supervisory status” (5 ILCS 315/3(r) (West 2008)), they nevertheless shall be considered. Here, there is no evidence that the Board considered the ordinance and policy code that clearly demonstrate the City’s plan to utilize sergeants as supervisors.\nIn addition to the ordinance and policies, the very nature and reality of the department’s staffing (again, not addressed in the Board’s decision and order) indicate the supervisory nature of the position of sergeant. The hierarchy of the department is limited; there is only one intermediate level between chief and patrol officer — that of sergeant. As Chief Olson testified, he was normally scheduled to work the 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. shift, 5 days a week, for a total of approximately 45 hours a week, although he “realistically” worked closer to 55 per week. When he was not at the department office — approximately 113 to 123 hours per week, or approximately 67% to 73% of the time — a sergeant was the highest-ranking officer, and the only officer with rank above patrol officer. It is unrealistic to conclude that patrol officers are unsupervised two-thirds to almost three-quarters of the time. The chief relies on the sergeants to ensure that the patrol officers are properly performing their jobs; they represent the interests of the chief vis-a-vis the patrol officers. See City of Freeport, 135 Ill. 2d at 519.\nThe Act excludes supervisors from bargaining units that contain their subordinates, in order to avoid the conflict of interest that arises when supervisors, who must apply the employer’s policies to the subordinates, are subject to control by the same union representing the subordinates. City of Freeport, 135 Ill. 2d at 517. It is clear from section 42—36(b)(1) of the Sandwich Municipal Code that a sergeant is responsible for all of the activities of the patrol officers on his shift. In addition, according to section 42— 36(b)(2)(c), sergeants are required to “[investigate complaints against a patrol officer on his shift and make a written report to the chief.” Sandwich Municipal Code ch. 42, §42—36(b)(2)(c). The Board determined that sergeants “do not have the authority to suspend or terminate subordinates, but recommend suspension or termination” and that “sergeants’ disciplinary recommendations are not always followed.” While true, these determinations truly miss the point of the policy underlying the statute. See City of Freeport, 135 Ill. 2d at 516.\nThe evidence in this case included various instances where the chief imposed disciplinary measures that were different (sometimes harsher, sometimes more lenient) from those recommended by the reporting sergeant. There was also at least one instance in which Olson imposed the discipline that had been recommended by the sergeant. However, the very fact that the sergeants are required to investigate complaints against patrol officers and submit reports to the chief shows the type of conflict of interest between sergeants and patrol officers that section 3(s)(1) of the Act seeks to prevent. Even if the sergeant does not ultimately impose the disciplinary action on a patrol officer, it is the sergeant who is required to bring the issue to the attention of the chief, who does impose the discipline. The sergeants must investigate complaints, must report any violations of policy or inappropriate actions, and may recommend that disciplinary action be taken. The power to issue documented verbal reprimands or to recommend more severe disciplinary action has been found to be authority to discipline. See City of Freeport, 135 Ill. 2d at 518-19; Village of Hazel Crest, 385 Ill. App. 3d at 117. There is no less of a conflict of interest where the sergeants are required to investigate, report, and recommend discipline as opposed to ultimately imposing the discipline.\nA sergeant’s independent judgment as to recommended discipline, as well as whether to even report an incident, might well be affected by bonds formed by common union brotherhood. See City of Freeport, 135 Ill. 2d at 519.\nThe Board’s decision is clearly erroneous and misses the forest for the trees. By mechanically applying section 3(r) of the Act, the Board failed to consider the policy underlying the Act and its application to the City’s police force as the force was designed and actually functions. We conclude that the City’s police sergeants do supervise the City’s patrol officers such that including the sergeants in the same bargaining unit as the patrol officers violated section 3(s)(1) of the Act. Therefore, we reverse the Board’s decision and order, and we vacate the certification of representation issued on August 17, 2009.\nBecause we have concluded that the supervisory authority of the sergeants is supported by the indicium of discipline, we need not address the other supervisory functions. See Village of Hazel Crest, 385 Ill. App. 3d at 114.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, case No. 2—09—0800 is dismissed; in case No. 2—09—0985, the agency’s decision and order are reversed and the certification of representation is vacated.\nNo. 2—09—0800, Appeal dismissed.\nNo. 2—09—0985, Reversed and certification of representation vacated.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

(West 2008)) (Consumer Fraud Act) against defendants Jose Alvarado and Marco’s Digital Video &amp; Photography, Inc. (Marco’s Digital Photography). Plaintiffs alleged they were the victims of an “immigration scam” perpetuated by defendants wherein defendants falsely promised plaintiffs they would obtain legalization or citizenship documents for plaintiffs. Plaintiffs each paid defendants $15,000 but defendants did not deliver on their promises and refused to return plaintiffs’ money. The court dismissed the complaint, finding the underlying contract was illegal and thus unenforceable. On appeal, plaintiffs argue the court erred in dismissing their complaint because (1) illegality of contract is not a proper defense against the causes of action pled in their complaint; (2) illegality of contract is not a defense to the Consumer Fraud Act’s regulation of immigration service providers; and (3) the court’s public policy determinations were inconsistent with the public policy of the Illinois legislature and Illinois precedent. We reverse.\nBackground\nOn December 7, 2009, plaintiffs (individually referred to as Gamboa, Nava and Lopez) filed a five-count verified complaint against defendants alleging (count I) violations of the Consumer Fraud Act; (count II) common law fraud; (count III) unjust enrichment; (count IV) civil conspiracy; and (count V) intentional infliction of emotional distress. The following course of dealings between the parties is taken from plaintiffs’ complaint.\nIn early 2006, Alvarado told plaintiffs he could obtain “authentic citizenship documents” for plaintiffs through a contact at the United States Consulate office in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, and plaintiffs would be able to use the documents to obtain social security numbers. He stated his contact could influence both American and Mexican immigration officials to expedite the application process but would need to pay employees in the different departments to obtain the necessary releases. The cost for adjustments to legal permanent residency status would be $12,000 per person and to obtain United States citizenship would add an additional $3,000 per person.\nAlvarado stated he and his brother were obtaining their citizenship documents through the contact and invited plaintiffs to join their group. He explained that once the contact obtained the necessary documents, the group would travel across the Mexican border and pick up the documents at the consulate office after having photos and fingerprints taken and a short interview. If plaintiffs could get their money to him by the end of June 2006, they could have their documents by October. Otherwise, there would be a six-month delay.\nPlaintiffs each made payments totaling $15,000 to Alvarado over a period of months and received receipts from Marco’s Digital Photography in return for their payments. Alvarado explained he was providing receipts from his business to assure plaintiffs that the process was legitimate. Gamboa made some of his payments at Alvarado’s home and at Marco’s Digital Photography. Nava and Lopez alleged Alvarado used “high-pressure tactics” to get the payments by the June deadline, calling them weekly until they had paid in full. Nava did not make his final payment until October 2006. Alvarado informed plaintiffs that, because the deadline had not been met, there would be a delay and plaintiffs would not receive their documents until December 2006.\nIn February 2007, Alvarado told Gamboa that Gamboa’s documents were ready and Gamboa needed to make plane reservations to fly to El Paso in order to cross the border and get the documents. Gamboa went to Marco’s Digital Photography, where Alvarado “purchased” the reservations for $500 plus a $25 credit card fee. Shortly before Gamboa was to leave, Alvarado told him his Mexican contact would not be able to get the documents and the trip was cancelled. Alvarado refunded Gamboa’s $500 but not the $25 fee.\nPlaintiffs regularly called Alvarado inquiring about the status of their documents. Alvarado avoided plaintiffs. After repeated calls from plaintiffs, he told them that his contact had suffered a heart attack which would delay obtaining the documents. He gave Lopez his contact’s phone number in Mexico. Lopez spoke to the contact, “Jose de Jesus Castellanos,” who confirmed Alvarado’s version of heart-attack-induced delay. At some later point, Alvarado stated the delays were due to problems in Phoenix and El Paso, which “Castellanos” confirmed when Gamboa called him.\nIn March 2009, Alvarado met with plaintiffs and told them that there was nothing he could do for them. He stated they had all been swindled by Castellanos and it was necessary to bring legal action in Mexico. He requested plaintiffs each pay him $200 to hire a Mexican lawyer and sign a power of attorney. Lopez and Nava paid and signed the power of attorney. Gamboa refused and demanded his money back. Alvarado subsequently called Nava and Lopez, asking if they knew what Gamboa was planning and threatened them that if Alvarado “fell, they would all fall.”\nPlaintiffs pressed Alvarado to return their money. In September 2009, Alvarado told Nava and Lopez the lawsuit was no longer a viable option and explained his new plan was to hire thugs in Mexico to kidnap Castellanos and get the money back from Castellanos in return for Castellanos’ release. If Castellanos did not return the money, Alvarado implied the kidnappers would kill Castellanos. Nava and Lopez told Alvarado they were opposed to the violence and did not want to be part of the kidnapping scheme. On October 29, 2009, Alvarado told Nava and Lopez the kidnapping was on hold.\nPlaintiffs’ complaint alleged defendants engaged in numerous instances of unfair and deceptive practices in the conduct of trade or commerce in violation of section 2AA of the Consumer Fraud Act (815 ILCS 505/2AA (West 2008)), which governs private providers of immigration assistance services. Plaintiffs also alleged defendants committed common law fraud by inducing plaintiffs to rely on their misrepresentations; defendants were unjustly enriched by the monies plaintiffs paid them; defendants engaged in a civil conspiracy to defraud plaintiffs; and defendants intended to inflict emotional distress on plaintiffs by making the malicious statements that if Alvarado fell, they would all fall. Plaintiffs requested the court enjoin defendants from engaging in conduct relating to the provision of immigration services or in any of the deceptive practices charged and payment of assorted damages, including $45,000 to each plaintiff as the civil penalty provided for by section 2AA(m) (815 ILCS 505/2AA(m) (West 2008)).\nDefendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to section 2—619 of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2—619 et seq. (West 2008)). Defendants asserted that count I should be dismissed pursuant to section 2—619(a)(5) because it was not commenced within the three-year statute of limitations for causes of action arising under the Consumer Fraud Act. They asserted the entire complaint should be dismissed pursuant to section 2—619(a)(9) because the agreement between the parties was an illegal contract that violated the law and public policy and courts refuse to enforce a contract when the purpose of the contract violates the law.\nThe court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss on all counts on May 17, 2010. It filed an amended order granting defendants’ motion to dismiss on all counts on June 9, 2010, explaining “this Court finds the facts, as pleaded in Plaintiffs’ verified complaint, show that Plaintiffs and Defendants entered into an illegal contract that violates the law and public policy.” It declared the order final and appealable. Plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal from the court’s orders on June 9, 2010. The court having disposed of all matters before the court, we have jurisdiction to consider this timely appeal.\nAnalysis\nIllegality of Contract\nThe court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss as to all counts of the complaint pursuant to section 2—619(a)(9) of the Code, finding the facts as pleaded in the complaint showed the parties entered into an illegal contract that violates the law and public policy, and thus, per defendants’ argument, is unenforceable. Section 2—619(a)(9) of the Code permits involuntary dismissal where “the claim asserted against defendant is barred by other affirmative matter avoiding the legal effect of or defeating the claim.” 735 ILCS 5/2—619(a)(9) (West 2008); Van Meter v. Darien Park District, 207 Ill. 2d 359, 367 (2003). An “ ‘affirmative matter,’ in a section 2—619(a)(9) motion, is something in the nature of a defense” which, although the moving party admits the legal sufficiency of the complaint, negates the cause of action completely. Van Meter, 207 Ill. 2d at 367; Borowiec v. Gateway 2000, Inc., 209 Ill. 2d 376, 383 (2004); Neppl v. Murphy, 316 Ill. App. 3d 581, 584 (2000). The defect, defense or affirmative matter must be apparent on the face of the pleading attacked or be supported by affidavit. Borowiec, 209 Ill. 2d at 383.\nIn reviewing a grant of a motion to dismiss, we accept as true all well-pleaded facts in the plaintiff’s complaint, draw all reasonable inferences from those facts in favor of the plaintiff and interpret all pleadings and supporting documents in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Morr-Fitz, Inc. v. Blagojevich, 231 Ill. 2d 474, 488 (2008); Borowiec, 209 Ill. 2d at 383. As with an appeal from a grant of summary judgment, we must consider “whether the existence of a genuine issue of material fact should have precluded the dismissal or, absent such an issue of fact, whether dismissal is proper as a matter of law,” and we review a court’s grant of a section 2—619 motion to dismiss de novo. Kedzie &amp; 103rd Currency Exchange, Inc. v. Hodge, 156 Ill. 2d 112, 116-17 (1993); Borowiec, 209 Ill. 2d at 383.\nTaking the well-pleaded facts in plaintiffs’ complaint as true, there is no question that the verbal contract between defendants and plaintiffs was illegal. Indeed, defendants admit that the parties entered into a contact that violates Illinois and federal law and public policy. They correctly describe the parties’ agreement as a “scheme” wherein the five members of the group agreed to obtain their residency or citizenship documents “by circumventing the normal, legal process that the public follows in obtaining such documents” such as by paying bribes and paying off government officials in violation of assorted criminal codes. Courts will not enforce an illegal contract, a contract that expressly contravenes either Illinois or federal law and thus violates public policy. Kim v. Citigroup, Inc., 368 Ill. App. 3d 298, 307 (2006). Illegality of contract is, therefore, a defense to actions seeking enforcement of a contract. Kim, 368 Ill. App. 3d at 307. Arguably, therefore, the illegality of the contract between plaintiffs and defendants would be a defense to plaintiffs’ enforcement of the contract.\n•1 But plaintiffs are not seeking to enforce the contract. Rather, they are seeking to be reimbursed for the monies they paid defendants on the basis of the apparently fraudulent contract, costs they incurred as a result of the contract and assorted punitive damages, including those provided for by section 2AA of the Consumer Fraud Act. As the basis for plaintiffs’ claimed relief, they are asserting (1) violations of section 2AA of the Consumer Fraud Act; (2) common law fraud; (3) unjust enrichment; (4) civil conspiracy; and (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress. They do not, in any of these counts, seek enforcement of the agreement they had with defendants or assert a breach of contract claim. Illegality of contract, therefore, would not be a valid defense to plaintiffs’ claims.\nWe do not find, notwithstanding defendants’ argument to the contrary, that allowing plaintiffs to proceed with their claims would be tantamount to allowing them to enforce an illegal contact. Plaintiffs seek compensation for defendants’ actions in violating the Consumer Fraud Act and in misleading them, in promising something they had no ability or intent to deliver with full knowledge that plaintiffs would be harmed financially and emotionally by their actions. We do not find that allowing plaintiffs’ case to proceed would, as defendants assert, give “the parties’ meeting of the minds legitimacy.” Nor do we find that it will “send a message to those who lawfully engage in the process of obtaining immigration papers that if you do not accomplish your goal legally and through proper channels, then it is okay to do it by illegal means such as bribery and paying off corrupt officials within a government.” On the contrary, allowing plaintiffs’ claims to proceed will send a message to those unscrupulous individuals who mislead and prey on others by promising them immigration services they cannot deliver that there are ramifications for this antisocial behavior. These individuals cannot be allowed to use the very illegality of their agreement as a way to avoid the consequences of their actions.\nGranted, generally, “parties to a void contract will be left where they have placed themselves with no recovery of the money paid for il legal services.” Ransburg v. Haase, 224 Ill. App. 3d 681, 686 (1992). However, exceptions to this rule have been recognized where (1) the person who paid for the services was not in pari delicto (“in equal fault” ) with the offender and (2) the law in question was passed for the protection of the person who paid for the services and the purpose of the law would be better served by granting relief than by denying it. Ransburg, 224 Ill. App. 3d at 686.\nOn the facts as they stand now, it appears plaintiffs were not in pari delicto with defendants: plaintiffs spoke little English, did not know defendants were lying/unable to deliver on their promises and would not necessarily know the agreement was illegal or that, as will be described below, they had recourse under section 2AA. Further, section 2AA was clearly passed for the protection of persons such as plaintiffs and would be best served if plaintiffs are allowed to proceed with their claims.\nSection 2AA was created to deter the abuses allegedly committed by defendants here. In section 2AA, the General Assembly, given the substantial effect on the public interest of private individuals providing or offering to provide immigration assistance services, established rules of practice and conduct for such individuals in order to promote honesty and fair dealing with Illinois residents and preserve public confidence. 815 ILCS 505/2AA(a—1), (a—5) (West 2008). Licensed attorneys, legal interns under the direct supervision of a licensed attorney, not-for-profit organizations recognized by the Board of Immigration Appeals, employees of such organizations and certain organizations employing or seeking to employ an alien or nonimmigrant alien are exempt from the requirements of section 2AA. 815 ILCS 505/2AA(a—5) (West 2008). There is nothing to show defendants were exempt from section 2AA nor do they assert such.\nUnder section 2AA, any nonexempt person who provides or offers to provide immigration assistance service may perform only services such as translating and completing government forms, transcribing and/or translating responses to such forms, securing supporting documents, notarizing signatures and assorted other services. 815 ILCS 505/2AA(b) (West 2008). He may not make any statement that he “can or will obtain special favors from or has special influence with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service or any other governmental agency” (815 ILCS 505/2AA(j)(1) (West 2008)); retain any compensation for service not performed (815 ILCS 505/2AA(j)(2) (West 2008)); provide legal advice, recommend a specific course of legal action or provide any other assistance that requires legal analysis, legal judgment or interpretation of the law or accept payment in exchange of such advice or assistance (815 ILCS 505/2AA(j)(2.5), (j)(5) (West 2008)); or “[m]ake any misrepresentation of false statement, directly or indirectly, to influence, persuade, or induce patronage” (815 ILCS 505/2AA(j)(6) (West 2008)).\nAny person perfoming any of the authorized services must register with the Illinois Attorney General and submit verification of malpractice insurance or a surety bond (815 ILCS 505/2AA(c) (West 2008)); provide the customer with a written contract explaining the services and costs in English and in the customer’s native language before performing any services (815 ILCS 505/2AA(d), (f) (West 2008)); and post a sign, a separate sign for each language in which he offers immigration assistance services, at his place of business stating he is not an attorney licensed to practice law and disclosing his fee schedule and assorted other information. 815 ILCS 505/2AA(e) (West 2008).\nPersons violating section 2AA shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor for a first offense and Class 3 felony for second or subsequent offenses. 815 ILCS 505/2AA(m) (West 2008). If the Attorney General or State’s Attorney fails to file an action under this section, any person may file a civil action to enforce the provisions of the section and maintain an action for injunctive relief or compensatory damages to recover prohibited fees. 815 ILCS 505/2AA(m) (West 2008). A prevailing plaintiff may be awarded three times the prohibited fees. 815 ILCS 505/2AA(m) (West 2008). Plaintiffs filed such a civil action here, seeking triple the amount they paid defendants pursuant to section 2AA(m).\nAgain taking the well-pleaded facts in plaintiffs’ complaint as true, there is no question that defendants were providers of immigration assistance services. There is also no question that they, as plaintiffs asserted in their complaint, violated section 2AA when they (1) failed to provide plaintiffs with a written contract explaining services to be performed and compensation to be charged in violation of section 2AA(d); (2) failed to provide plaintiffs with a written contract in English and Spanish, the language spoken by plaintiffs, in violation of section 2AA(f); (3) failed to post signs with the mandated disclosures at Marco’s Digital Photography in violation of section 2AA(e); (4) retained plaintiffs’ money after failing to obtain the promised documents, misrepresented to plaintiffs they could assist them in obtaining immigration documents and misrepresented that Castellanos was employed by the United States Consulate in Juarez, Mexico, in violation of section 2AA(j); and (5) failed to file the required registration statement or verification of malpractice statement or surety bond in violation of section 2AA(c).\nAs plaintiffs point out, defendants are essentially arguing that the very actions that section 2AA attempts to curtail can be used as a defense to claims brought under section 2AA. Section 2AA was passed for the protection of people such as plaintiffs. The purpose of section 2AA can best be effectuated by recognizing plaintiffs’ right to recovery. We find, therefore, that the court erred in dismissing plaintiffs’ complaint on the basis of illegality of contract.\nStatute of Limitations for Count I\n•2 In its order dismissing the complaint, the court did not mention defendants’ alternate argument for dismissal of count I. Defendants had argued, pursuant to section 2—619(a)(5) of the Code, that the Consumer Fraud Act count should be dismissed because it was filed beyond the three-year statute of limitations for filing such actions. Neither party raises this ground for dismissal on appeal, so we need not consider it. However, since it may come up again on remand and there is no merit to this argument, we will address it briefly.\nUnder section 2—619(a)(5), dismissal may be had upon a showing that the plaintiffs’ action was not commenced within the time limit provided by law. 735 ILCS 5/2—619(5) (West 1992); Streeter v. Chicago Transit Authority, 272 Ill. App. 3d 921, 923, 651 N.E.2d 579, 580 (1995). The statute of limitations for an action under the Consumer Fraud Act is three years and begins to run when the cause of action accrues. 815 ILCS 505/10a(e) (West 2008); Kopley Group V, L.P. v. Sheridan Edgewater Properties, Ltd., 376 Ill. App. 3d 1006, 1020-21 (2007). A cause of action that is not filed within the statute of limitations is time barred. 815 ILCS 505/10a(e) (West 2002); Kopley Group V., L.P, 376 Ill. App. 3d at 1021.\nPlaintiffs filed their cause of action on December 7, 2009. Accordingly, in order to meet the three-year statute of limitations for their Consumer Fraud Act claim, the claim had to accrue on or after December 7, 2006. Defendants asserted plaintiffs’ cause of action accrued in October 2006, when Nava made his final payment. We disagree.\nA cause of action under the Consumer Fraud Act accrues “ ‘when a person knows or reasonably should know of his injury and also knows or reasonably should know that it was wrongfully caused. At that point the burden is upon the injured person to inquire further as to the existence of a cause of action.’ ” (Emphasis omitted.) Kopley Group V, L.P, 376 Ill. App. 3d at 1021 (quoting Witherell v. Weimer, 85 Ill. 2d 146, 156 (1981)). Taking the well-pleaded facts in plaintiffs’ complaint as true for the purposes of the motion to dismiss, it is clear plaintiffs had no reason to know or suspect that they had been injured, let alone defrauded, in October 2006. Throughout the time that plaintiffs were making their payments, April 2006 through October 2006, Alvarado consistently called one or all of them, sometimes weekly, asking for the money. He told plaintiffs that if the June 2006 deadline for payment was missed, the documents would be delayed by up to six months, and he even used the supposed delay as a form of threat on occasion. There would be no reason for plaintiffs to suspect in October 2006 that they were the victims of fraud; they knew the June deadline had been missed and therefore would not expect any documents until December 2006, at the earliest. Alvarado reinforced this expectation when, after receiving the last “late” payment in October 2006, he told Gamboa that, due to the delay in payment, the documents would not be ready until November or December 2006. It was, therefore, reasonable for plaintiffs to continue thinking through December 2006 that their agreement with Alvarado would be honored.\nIt was not until sometime after December 2006, when plaintiffs still had not received the promised documents and Alvarado stopped responding to their phone calls, that plaintiffs might have had reason to suspect something was wrong, that Alvarado might not deliver on the agreements. It is not clear from plaintiffs’ complaint when such occurred, but it clearly occurred after December 2006, spanning a period of months, and ultimately years. Alvarado still strung Gamboa along as late as February 2007, when he told Gamboa he had to go to El Paso, “booked” Gamboa’s airline reservations and then cancelled his trip at the last minute. From mid-2007 through 2009, Alvarado sporadically gave plaintiffs additional excuses for his failure to procure the documents, put them in contact with Castellanos to verify the excuses, told them he’d been swindled too and much, much more. But, by that time, plaintiffs should have been aware that they had been injured and investigated further. Accordingly, we find plaintiffs’ cause of action under the Consumer Fraud Act accrued sometime in 2007, within the three-year statute of limitations for such actions.\nFor the reasons stated above, we reverse the order of the trial court and remand for further proceedings.\nReversed and remanded.\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 794 (7th ed. 1999).&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

Plaintiff alleged that defendant unlawfully imposed suspensions and fines on plaintiffs members when buses that they operated were photographed running red traffic lights. The circuit court granted defendant’s motion to dismiss the complaint under section 2—619 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2—619 (West 2008)), finding that a collective bargaining agreement, which contained a grievance and arbitration process, governed the dispute between the parties. We affirm.\nBACKGROUND\nOur recitation of the facts of this case is drawn from plaintiffs complaint, which we take as true when reviewing a motion to dismiss under section 2—619 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2—619 (West 2008)). See Coady v. Harpo, Inc., 308 Ill. App. 3d 153, 158-59 (1999).\nDefendant is a division of the Regional Transportation Authority, which provides public transportation in the Chicago area. Among other duties, defendant operates buses on routes throughout western Cook County. Plaintiff is a labor organization that is composed of and represents the collective interests of defendant’s employees, including bus drivers.\nBeginning in 2006, municipalities in western Cook County began installing “red light cameras” at intersections in their jurisdictions. Red light cameras work by automatically taking photographs of any vehicle that enters an intersection while the traffic signal in that direction is red. See 625 ILCS 5/11—208.6 (West 2008). Under authority granted to them by the Illinois Vehicle Code (625 ILCS 5/11—208.3(a) (West 2008)), these municipalities also created a system of administrative adjudication for violations of automated traffic laws (625 ILCS 5/11—208.6 (West 2008)). By statute, when red light cameras capture a violation, the municipality is required to mail written notice of the violation to the registered owner of the vehicle. See 625 ILCS 5/11—208.6(d) (West 2008). The notice must include copies of the photographs taken of the vehicle by the red light camera, as well as other information such as the date, time, and location of the alleged violation. See 625 ILCS 5/11—208.6(d)(1) through (d)(10) (West 2008). Registered owners may choose to pay the civil fine for the violation, or they may contest the violation at an administrative hearing. See 625 ILCS 5/11—208.6(d)(10) (West 2008). The only statutory defenses available to the registered owner at the hearing are either that the vehicle or its plates were reported as stolen before the alleged violation, or that the driver of the vehicle entered the intersection in order to yield to an emergency vehicle or as part of a funeral procession. See 625 ILCS 5/11—208.6(h) (West 2008). There are no provisions in the statute that anyone other than the registered owner of a vehicle is legally responsible for payment of a fine assessed under section 11—208.6.\nThis case arose when defendant began receiving traffic tickets for violations of section 11—208.6. Defendant learned from these notices that buses that it owned and operated had allegedly run red lights at intersections with red light cameras. According to the complaint, defendant began “effectively reassigning” these traffic tickets to the bus drivers who had been operating the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. Under defendant’s alleged policy, defendant requires the bus driver to pay the fine and suspends the driver for between one and five days, with the possibility of termination of employment for three or more violations. The complaint alleges that defendant does not provide either the driver or plaintiff with a copy of the ticket or photographs of the alleged violation in a timely manner, which prevents the driver from contesting the charge.\nThe complaint asserted that defendant’s policy is illegal because, according to the Vehicle Code, only the registered owner of the vehicle is legally obligated to pay the fine, not the driver at the time of the alleged violation. Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that defendant’s practice of “reassigning” the traffic ticket to its employees is not justified by Illinois law and is ultra vires. Plaintiff further sought an injunction that would require defendant to give timely notice of any alleged violation of section 11—208.6 and would prohibit defendant from requiring its drivers to pay fines associated with the alleged violations.\nDefendant moved to dismiss the complaint under section 2—619(a)(9) of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2—619(a)(9) (West 2008)). In its motion, defendant argued that the parties had entered into a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which contained a binding grievance and arbitration procedure for any disputes that arise under the CBA. Defendant contended that, although plaintiff framed its allegations in terms of unlawful “reassignment” of traffic tickets, plaintiffs complaint was in reality directed at the manner in which defendant disciplined its employees for on-the-job traffic violations. Defendant attached to its motion the four pages of the CBA that deal with the grievance process, as well as a clause that states, “[Plaintiff] agrees that it will not in any way interfere with or attempt to limit the right of [defendant] to discharge or discipline its employees for any reason where sufficient cause can be shown.” Defendant argued that, because the CBA deals with the specific issue that is in dispute, plaintiff must exhaust its contractual remedies under the CBA before bringing an action in the circuit court.\nAfter full briefing by the parties, the circuit court heard oral argument on January 21, 2010. The circuit court rejected plaintiffs arguments and agreed with defendant, stating “I don’t find [defendant’s] action here to be contradictory or in violation of the law. [Defendant] is acknowledging for purposes of the motion that they have a legal obligation to pay [the tickets]. I *** find that it is in fact a grievance related to the performance of the job duties and that the matter should be arbitrated under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.” The circuit court granted defendant’s motion to dismiss with prejudice, and plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.\nANALYSIS\nOn appeal, plaintiff argues that the CBA does not cover the defendant’s actions and that this matter is therefore not required to go through the grievance and arbitration process spelled out in the CBA. Defendant counters that the trial court properly dismissed the complaint because defendant’s policy is related to the discipline of its employees, which is covered by the CBA.\nWe review an order of dismissal under section 2—619(a)(9) of the Code of Civil Procedure de novo, accepting as true all well-pled facts contained in the complaint and in any uncontradicted affidavits attached to the motion. See Coady v. Harpo, Inc., 308 Ill. App. 3d 153, 158-59 (1999). The question on review is “ ‘whether the existence of a genuine issue of material fact should have precluded the dismissal or, absent such an issue of fact, whether dismissal is proper as a matter of law.’ ” Doyle v. Holy Cross Hospital, 186 Ill. 2d 104, 110 (1999), quoting Kedzie &amp; 103rd Currency Exchange, Inc. v. Hodge, 156 Ill. 2d 112, 116-17 (1993).\nNeither party disputes the facts as they are laid out in the complaint, and neither party denies that the portion of the CBA that we have in the record is accurate and is binding upon the parties. Ordinarily, if a collective bargaining agreement exists and it contains a grievance and arbitration procedure, “an employee alleging a violation of the agreement must attempt to exhaust his or her contractual remedies before seeking judicial relief.” Kostecki v. Dominick’s Finer Foods, Inc., of Illinois, 361 Ill. App. 3d 362, 369 (2005). However, only “grievances” are subject to arbitration, and any claims that are not covered by the agreement may be pursued in the circuit court. See id. at 369-70. Consequently, the only question that we must decide on appeal is whether defendant’s policy of suspending drivers accused of red light camera violations and requiring them to pay the fines is a grievance within the meaning of the CBA.\nWe initially note that the portion of the CBA in the record does not contain a definition of the term “grievance.” However, “[e]n-grafted on every written contract are the customs, practices and definitions which are commonly understood and accepted by the parties.” Colgan v. Rae-Ann Electric Co., 91 Ill. App. 3d 386, 390 (1980). Our supreme court has noted that a grievance is generally understood to mean “any complaint by an employee concerning any aspect of the employment relationship.” City of Freeport v. Illinois State Labor Relations Board, 135 Ill. 2d 499, 530 (1990), quoting Roberts’ Dictionary of Industrial Relations 170-71 (1971). Because the employment relationship between the parties here is governed by the CBA, we take the term “grievance” to mean any dispute over the rights and obligations of the parties as they are defined by the CBA.\nOur first task is to determine the nature of the actions at issue. Plaintiff complains of three aspects of defendant’s policy: (1) suspending and possibly terminating drivers for alleged red light camera violations, (2) failing to give drivers sufficient notice of the allegations against them, and (3) requiring drivers to pay the fines for the red light camera violations. We find that the first portion of the policy is properly characterized as a disciplinary issue. The complaint itself alleges that defendant “disciplines Bus Operators [who are] reassigned red light tickets or citations by suspending them.” (Emphasis added.) Disciplinary actions are explicitly addressed in the CBA, in which plaintiff agreed not to interfere with defendant’s right to discipline or discharge its employees. Because suspension is a disciplinary matter and is therefore within the scope of the CBA, any dispute over this issue must be submitted through the CBA’s grievance process.\nThe second portion of the policy is also related to employee discipline. The complaint asserts that “Bus Operators have a right to timely notice of any traffic violations that they are alleged to have committed. [Defendant’s] practice, policy or custom *** deprives Bus Operators of the timely notice required. *** [Defendant’s] illegal practice, policy or custom has resulted in Bus Operators incurring and paying unjustified and increased fines and penalties as well as suspensions and other discipline.” (Emphasis added.) As noted above, defendant has a right to discipline its employees. However, the CBA explicitly limits defendant’s right only to situations where “sufficient cause can be shown.” The plain meaning of plaintiff’s allegation is that, by not providing sufficient notice of the alleged traffic violation to an employee, defendant has failed to demonstrate sufficient justification for imposing discipline on that employee. A dispute between the parties over whether defendant is disciplining its employees without sufficient cause is an issue that is explicitly covered by the CBA, and consequently, it must also be addressed through the CBA’s grievance process.\nThe third portion of the policy is more difficult to characterize. Plaintiff argues that defendant is the only entity that is legally obligated to pay red light camera citations and that its practice of “reassigning” the ticket to its bus drivers and forcing the bus driver to pay the ticket is illegal and ultra vires. “An ‘assignment’ is a transfer of property or some other right from one person (the ‘assignor’) to another (the ‘assignee’), which confers a complete and present right in the subject matter to the assignee. An assignment is a contract between the assignor and the assignee, and is interpreted or construed according to the rules of contract construction.” 6 Am. Jur. 2d Assignments §1 (2008). Common law and statutory rights are generally assignable, absent a clear statute or public policy to the contrary. See 6 Am. Jur. 2d Assignments §7 (2008). Plaintiff characterizes defendant’s policy of requiring bus drivers to pay the red light ticket as an “assignment,” and it sought a judicial declaration that such an assignment is void as against public policy.\nHowever, we find that defendant’s policy is not an assignment. Even assuming, without deciding, that a red light camera citation is assignable, there is no indication in the complaint that an assignment has occurred in this case. Plaintiff does not indicate that there is any contract of assignment between defendant and the bus drivers who are accused of running red lights, and without such an agreement there can be no assignment. Indeed, the complaint does not allege that an assignment occurred at all. Instead, the complaint merely alleges that defendant is “effectively reassigning” (emphasis added) the citations, indicating that no assignment in the legal sense has occurred.\nMoreover, the bus drivers themselves do not appear to actually pay the fine to municipalities. If an assignment of a red light camera citation had occurred, then the bus driver would be obligated to pay the fine directly to the municipality. That does not appear to be the case here. Rather, it seems that defendant pays the fine, and then defendant requires bus drivers to reimburse it for the amount paid to the municipality. The complaint specifically alleges that defendant has “demanded that the employee Bus Operators pay for the red light tickets or citations” and that defendant “has in fact collected payments from Bus Operators after demanding that they pay red light camera violations.” (Emphasis added.)\nBased on plaintiffs own allegations, defendant does not “assign” the red light citation to its employees. Rather, defendant’s policy is that its employees must reimburse it for the citations that it is obligated to pay to municipalities due to red light camera violations. There is consequently no transfer of a right or an obligation from defendant to its employees, meaning that no assignment of the traffic citation has occurred. As a result, we find that defendant’s action is properly characterized as disciplinary in nature because it imposes a monetary sanction on the employee for an alleged violation of a traffic law to the detriment of defendant. As a disciplinary matter, defendant’s practice of fining employees for red light camera violations falls under the CBA, and any dispute over this issue must be submitted through the grievance process.\nAlthough we find that each component of defendant’s policy is covered by the CBA and therefore must be addressed through the CBA’s grievance procedures, plaintiff contends that the circuit court may still address plaintiffs claims because they exist independently of the CBA. Plaintiff relies on three cases for this proposition, but we find that each of these cases is distinguishable.\nFirst, plaintiff relies on Semmens v. Board of Education of Pontiac Community Consolidated School District No. 429, 190 Ill. App. 3d 174 (1989). In Semmens, a group of teachers claimed that they had been unlawfully denied a duty-free lunch period of at least 30 minutes each day, in violation of section 24—9 of the School Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 122, par. 24—9). See Semmens, 190 Ill. App. 3d at 176. The circuit court granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss on the ground that a collective bargaining agreement between the teachers and the school district required arbitration of any dispute before the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board. See id. The collective bargaining agreement contained a section entitled “Lunch Period,” but the section was completely blank. See id. at 177. The appellate court reversed, finding that the collective bargaining agreement did not address the lunch period issue and that arbitration therefore was not mandatory. See id. at 181.\nUnlike Semmens, the CBA in the instant case deals directly with discipline of employees. The CBA does not contain any specific clauses that specify what offenses an employee may be disciplined for, but this fact does not take the issue of discipline itself outside the scope of the CBA. The collective bargaining agreement in Semmens demonstrably failed to address the issue of a lunch period. In contrast, the parties’ present dispute is whether and how an employee may be disciplined for a red light camera citation, which is an issue that falls within the discipline clause of the CBA. We consequently find that Semmens is distinguishable.\nSecond, plaintiff cites Daniels v. Board of Education of the City of Chicago, 277 Ill. App. 3d 968 (1996). In Daniels, the plaintiffs sued to recover the value of accrued vacation days that they had not been able to use prior to being laid off by the defendant. See id. The trial court dismissed the complaint because the plaintiffs had not first exhausted their remedies under their collective bargaining agreement, which contained a section outlining how vacation days accumulate. See id. The appellate court reversed, finding that, although the collective bargaining agreement did address the issue of vacation days, the plaintiffs’ cause of action did not arise under the agreement. See id. at 972. Instead, the court found that the plaintiffs had an independent statutory right to compensation for unused vacation days under the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act (820 ILCS 115/5 (West 1992)).\nUnlike Daniels, there is no independent statutory right at issue here. Plaintiff argues that its action for declaratory judgment and an injunction arises from section 11—208.6 of the Vehicle Code (625 ILCS 5/11—208.6 (West 2008)), which requires a municipality to issue a citation for a red light camera violation to “the registered owner of the vehicle as the alleged violator.” 625 ILCS 5/11—208.6(d) (West 2008). We do not agree with plaintiffs analysis. There is no indication in the complaint that defendant has caused any municipality to illegally issue a citation to an individual who is not the registered owner. Indeed, defendant acknowledges that it has a legal obligation to pay the fines because it owns the vehicles accused of violating section 11—208.6. Despite plaintiffs contentions, its cause of action arises from defendant’s alleged violation of the disciplinary clause of the CBA, not independently from a state statute. Daniels is therefore distinguishable.\nFinally, plaintiff relies on Croom v. City of De Kalb, 71 Ill. App. 3d 370 (1979). In Croom, the plaintiff firefighters sought an injunction that would require the defendant to abide by an arbitration clause in their collective bargaining agreement during a dispute over additional pay for performing certain duties. See id. at 370-71. The agreement did not contain any provision that dealt with additional pay, and both the circuit court and the appellate court found that the parties had therefore not agreed to arbitrate that issue. See id. at 376.\nWe find Croom to be distinguishable for two reasons. First, the arbitration clause in Croom mandated arbitration only for grievances over express provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. See id. at 375. Because the question of additional pay was not expressly addressed in the agreement, it was therefore not subject to arbitration. See id. at 375-76. Unlike Croom, the CBA in the instant case requires all grievances that “arise under” the CBA to be submitted through the grievance process. This language is significantly broader than in Croom, and therefore a broader category of grievances than those expressly mentioned in the CBA are subject to arbitration. Second, discipline of defendant’s employees is explicitly within the scope of the CBA, which is the opposite factual situation as that in Croom and which therefore requires a different result. Croom is consequently distinguishable.\nCONCLUSION\nDefendant’s policy of imposing suspensions and fines on employees accused of red light camera violations is a disciplinary matter. Additionally, the issue of the sufficiency of notice that defendant provides to its employees regarding alleged red light camera violations is a dispute over defendant’s method of disciplining its employees. Because defendant’s right to discipline its employees is a grievance that is within the scope of the CBA, it is subject to the grievance and arbitration process specified in the CBA. Plaintiff did not exhaust its contractual remedies under the CBA prior to bringing the instant action in the circuit court, and as a result, the circuit court properly dismissed the complaint.\nAffirmed.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

Epstein &amp; Sons International, Inc. (Epstein), appeals the judgment of the circuit court of Cook County granting defendant, Eppstein Uhen Architects, Inc.’s (EUA) motion for summary judgment pursuant to section 2—1005 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2—1005 (West 2008)) and denying Epstein’s motion for partial summary judgment. We reverse the judgment of the circuit court granting EUA’s motion for summary judgment and affirm the circuit court’s judgment denying Epstein’s motion for partial summary judgment. We find that the terms in the parties’ first alleged contract are ambiguous and require the aid of extrinsic evidence to determine the parties’ intent. Therefore, summary judgment was not proper.\nJURISDICTION\nOn April 24, 2009, the circuit court entered its final judgment denying Epstein’s motion to reconsider. On May 22, 2009, Epstein filed its notice of appeal. Accordingly, this court has jurisdiction pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rules 301 and 303 governing appeals from final judgments entered below. Ill. S. Ct. R. 301 (eff. Feb. 1, 1994); R. 303 (eff. May 30, 2008).\nBACKGROUND\nIn December of 2002, Franciscan Communities, d/b/a St. Joseph Home of Chicago, hired EUA to provide professional design services for a construction project in Chicago, Illinois. EUA then called upon Epstein to submit a proposal for it to provide engineering design services for Franciscan’s construction project. Epstein submitted a signed proposal on November 6, 2002, and EUA accepted it by signing it on December 2, 2002. Displeased with EUA’s performance on its construction project, Franciscan filed an arbitration demand against EUA in December of 2007. In turn, EUA filed an arbitration demand upon Epstein in January 2008, asserting claims arising out of Franciscan’s arbitration demand.\nEpstein filed a petition to stay arbitration and complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief in May of 2008. Epstein attached two documents to its petition that are at the center of the dispute between the parties. The first document, titled “MEPFP Engineering Services Proposal” is dated November 6, 2002 (November document). The second document attached to Epstein’s petition is dated December 9, 2002, and titled “Architect-Consultant Agreement” (December document). The dispute is whether Epstein is bound by an arbitration provision which is set out in a third unattached document, AIA Document C141 — 1997 (AIA provision) that the December document purports to incorporate by reference.\nThe November document described the project; outlined the engineering design services, administrative services, and structural engineering services plaintiff agreed to provide and in what manner; as well as set out fees and expenses. The November document also attached and incorporated terms and conditions of service. The terms and conditions of service state that EUA will be bound by the terms of the November document once it is executed. Furthermore, any modifications to those terms must be made in writing. Nothing in the November document mentions that disputes between the parties will be resolved in arbitration. The relevant provisions of the November document’s terms and conditions of service are as follows:\n“1. These Terms and Conditions of Services are an integral part of the Proposal dated November 6, 2002 between [Epstein] and [EUA],\n2. *** Upon execution of this Proposal by [EUA] ***, [EUA] shall be bound by the Proposal and all of these Terms and Conditions of Service ***. Any additions, deletions, or changes to the Proposal or these Terms and Conditions of Services shall be in writing and executed by both Parties.\n3. (a) The services described in the Proposal constitute the Scope of Services that Epstein agrees to provide to [EUA] under this Agreement.\n(c) If, during Epstein’s performance of the Scope of Services, [EUA] requests, in writing, a change in the Scope of Services ***, such Change in Service and method of compensation shall be agreed to in writing prior to Epstein being obligated to undertake such Change in Service. If Epstein performs such Change in Service and this Subparagraph (c) has not been complied with, Epstein shall be compensated at its then prevailing hourly rates.\n(d) The Scope of the Project is set forth in the Proposal. The scope of the Project shall not be altered without the written consent of both Epstein and [EUA]. In the event that the parties consent to alter the scope of the Project, the Scope of Services and the fees and charges for the Project as set forth in this Agreement shall be adjusted in accordance with subparagraph (c) of this Paragraph 3.\n* * *\n21. This Agreement constitutes the entire integrated Agreement between [EUA] and Epstein, and supercedes all prior negotiations, representations, or agreements, whether written or oral except as are specifically incorporated into this Agreement by reference. This Agreement may not be amended except by written instrument signed by both [EUA] and Epstein.\n22. This Agreement shall he governed by the laws of the State of Illinois.”\nEpstein signed the November document on November 6, 2002, and EUA signed it on December 6, 2002.\nThe December document stated that Epstein agreed to provide “Civil, Structural, and MEP-FP engineering consulting design services” for a fixed fee of $275,000. The December document also outlines how the construction documents are to be produced and stored, as well as billing and insurance provisions. Most importantly, the December document referenced an unattached document, the AIA provision, that requires disputes between the parties to be settled by arbitration. The December document provides in pertinent part as follows:\n“Said Engineering Services shall be provided in accordance with the requirements set forth in the AIA Document C141—1997 Standard Form of Agreement Between [EUA] and [Epstein] in its entirety (Pages 1-14) for the engineering service disciplines named above including such additional amendments as listed below:\nA. Consulting services shall be as specified in [Epstein’s] letter dated November 6, 2002.”\nEUA signed the December document on December 9, 2002, and Epstein signed it on December 16, 2002. Although not attached to the December document originally, Epstein attached the AIA provision to its petition, which in relevant part provided:\n“§9.2.1 Any claim, dispute or other matter in question arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be subject to arbitration. Prior to arbitration, the parties shall endeavor to resolve disputes by mediation ***.”\nIn its petition, Epstein alleged that it only signed the December document because it was told by EUA’s project manager that the December document was necessary in order to process payments to Epstein. Epstein alleged that the December document identified the same scope of services as the November document, the fees were the same, and EUA did not provide any consideration for Epstein’s agreement to submit to arbitration. In count I of its petition, Epstein sought a stay of arbitration pursuant to section 2 of the Illinois Uniform Arbitration Act (710 ILCS 5/2(b) (West 2008)), alleging that the November document did not contain any provisions compelling arbitration. In count II of its petition, Epstein sought a declaratory judgment, requesting the circuit court enter a judgment declaring that the November document “is the agreement between Epstein and EUA governing the provision of services by Epstein on the project” and that the December document “does not constitute a valid and binding modification” to the November document and that the November document does not require disputes between the parties to be submitted to arbitration.\nOn November 10, 2008, EUA filed a motion for summary judgment. 735 ILCS 5/2—1005 (West 2008). In its motion, EUA alleged that its arbitration demand was based solely on the December document and that it is irrelevant that the November document does not contain an arbitration clause. EUA alleged further that because the arbitration demand was based solely on the December document, and not the November document, there is no ripe case or controversy between the parties relative to the November document. Epstein responded that the December document is not a valid and binding agreement because it lacks consideration, namely, that EUA has not shown how Epstein received any benefit from the December document that it had not already received in the November document. Epstein responded further that even if the December document is the controlling agreement between the parties, it does not contain an express agreement to arbitrate. Instead, Epstein argues that the December document is ambiguous. EUA replied that the December document is not ambiguous and that it contained adequate consideration, namely, a flat fee of $275,000, the agreement to arbitrate, as well as insurance and indemnification provisions. EUA replied that the plain language of the December document incorporated the AIA provision and that even if the November document is considered a contract between the parties, the December document is a valid modification of the November document.\nAlso on November 10, 2008, Epstein filed its own motion for partial summary judgment as to count I of its petition seeking a determination by the circuit court that the December document’s reference to the AIA provision is not sufficient to obligate Epstein to submit to arbitration. In doing so, Epstein did not concede that the December document was the operative agreement between the parties, but rather sought a determination that as a matter of law, there is nothing in the December document that would compel arbitration. EUA responded that the plain language of the December document shows an agreement between the parties to submit to arbitration. In its reply, Epstein maintained that the December document does not require it to submit to arbitration because the reference in the December document to the AIA provision was for the limited purpose of describing engineering services that Epstein was required to provide, not to compel arbitration.\nOn January 30, 2009, the circuit court denied Epstein’s motion for partial summary judgment and granted EUA’s motion for summary judgment. The circuit court found the December document to be the governing contract between the parties and held that the December document contained an agreement to arbitrate. The circuit court reasoned that the November document appeared to be a proposal between the parties. Additionally, the circuit court found that the December document’s language was clear and unambiguous that the AIA provision was to be incorporated into the agreement in its entirety. On April 24, 2009, the circuit court denied Epstein’s motion to reconsider the circuit court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of EUA as to count II of Epstein’s petition. Epstein timely appeals.\nANALYSIS\nOn appeal, Epstein argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment. As to count I, Epstein argues summary judgment was improper because the December agreement’s terms on the AIA provision are ambiguous. As to count II, Epstein argues summary judgment was improper because a genuine issue of material fact remained in dispute, namely, which document controlled. Epstein contends the circuit court’s finding that the December document was the only agreement between the parties concerned a disputed issue of material fact not appropriately decided at the summary judgment stage. EUA, on the other hand, argues that the circuit court properly entered summary judgment in its favor because the December document is the operative agreement between the parties and its terms requiring arbitration are clear and unambiguous.\nSummary judgment is proper where “the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” 735 ILCS 5/2—1005(c) (West 2008). In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the circuit court is to determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, not try a question of fact. Williams v. Manchester, 228 Ill. 2d 404, 417 (2008). When determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the pleadings are to be liberally construed in favor of the nonmoving party. Id. We recognize that “[although summary judgment can aid in the expeditious disposition of a lawsuit, it remains a drastic means of disposing of litigation and, therefore, should be allowed only where the right of the moving party is clear and free from doubt.” Id. We review summary judgment rulings de novo. Id.\nAn instrument’s legal effect is not “to be determined by the label which it bears or the technical terms it contains.” Bonde v. Weber, 6 Ill. 2d 365, 377 (1955). Rather, it is the intention of the parties that governs. Illinois Central R.R. Co. v. Michigan Central R.R. Co., 18 Ill. App. 2d 462, 474 (1958). When determining whether a document is a binding contract, we must consider whether the three basic elements of a contract are present, namely, an offer, acceptance, and consideration. Steinberg v. Chicago Medical School, 69 Ill. 2d 320, 329 (1977). “Consideration consists of some detriment to the offeror, some benefit to the offeree, or some bargained-for exchange between them.” Doyle v. Holy Cross Hospital, 186 Ill. 2d 104, 112 (1999). However, “if the alleged consideration for a promise has been conferred prior to the promise upon which alleged agreement is based, there is no valid contract.” Johnson v. Johnson, 244 Ill. App. 3d 518, 528 (1993).\nIn reviewing the language of a contract, the “circuit court must initially determine, as a question of law, whether the language *** is ambiguous as to the parties’ intent.” Quake Construction, Inc. v. American Airlines, Inc., 141 Ill. 2d 281, 288 (1990). Where the terms of a contract are clear and unambiguous, the parties’ intent must be derived solely from the document. Id. If the terms of the alleged contract are ambiguous or capable of more than one interpretation, parole evidence is admissible tó determine the parties’ intent. Id. Suftimary judgment is not proper where a purported contract contains ambiguous terms, which require admission of extrinsic evidence to interpret them. Loyola Academy v. S&amp;S Roof Maintenance, Inc., 146 Ill. 2d 263, 272 (1992).\nThe circuit court’s finding that the December document controlled was primarily determined by the fact that the November document is titled “proposal.” EUA’s briefed position was that the November document is a proposal, not a contract. At oral argument, EUA admitted that the proposal was an executed binding contract and our analysis continues with that being a given. Both the November and December documents cannot be reconciled on the issues as to the requirement of arbitration. Epstein maintains that the December document was a formality to insure proper payment, not a modification of the November agreement. EUA argues that the December document is the controlling contract as it modified the November agreement. The intent of the parties is ambiguous, and therefore, parole evidence must be considered in determining the parties’ intent behind these documents. Accordingly, summary judgment is not appropriate. Loyola Academy, 146 Ill. 2d at 272 (summary judgment not appropriate where an alleged contract is ambiguous and parole evidence is needed to interpret the intent of the parties).\nSummary judgment is also not appropriate because the November document raises other fact issues that need to be addressed at trial. Specifically, if the November document is a valid contract, whether the December document is supported by sufficient consideration such that it is a proper modification of that contract is an issue of fact. Epstein argues that any alleged consideration in the December document was illusory because the fee in the December document is the same fee in the November document. EUA argues that the December agreement contains different consideration from that provided in the November document, namely, that EUA agrees to pay Epstein a flat fee of $275,000. The November document contains a fee of approximately $200,000 and a fee structure for expenses. It is not clear if the November document and the December document contain the same fee once expenses are added. This is a genuine issue of material fact that precludes summary judgment. If, as Epstein alleges, the December document was not based on any new consideration, then the December document would not be a valid contract. See Johnson, 244 Ill. App. 3d at 528. In construing the pleadings against EUA as the movant, the issue of consideration is a material fact that is disputed by the parties and, thus, also precludes summary judgment.\nA review of the record shows that before the circuit court, EUA maintained that the November document was a proposal, as opposed to an agreement between the parties. EUA additionally briefed that as fact in its response to this appeal. However, at oral argument, EUA conceded that the November document was in fact an agreement between the parties. This discrepancy concerns us. The circuit court may well have ruled differently had the court had the benefit of the concession of the November document being an agreement between the parties as opposed to a proposal. Due to this discrepancy, as well as the need for the aid of extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of the parties, summary judgment is not proper in this case.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court of Cook County is affirmed in part and reversed in part and the cause is remanded.\nAffirmed in part and reversed in part; cause remanded.\nEpstein’s petition included a count III, but Epstein voluntarily dismissed this count on August 29, 2008.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

On March 16, 2007, the circuit court of Du Page County entered an order dissolving the 25-year marriage of the parties, Bruce and Cecily Schinelli. The trial court divided the marital estate evenly, factoring in against Bruce’s share a charge for dissipation in the amount of $26,273. The trial court ordered permanent maintenance to Cecily in the amount of $6,692 per month. Additionally, the trial court ordered additional maintenance to Cecily in the amount of one-third of Bruce’s annual gross income between $200,000 and $650,000 (supplemental maintenance). Bruce appealed from that order. In the first appeal, Bruce argued that the trial court erred in (1) setting the amount of permanent maintenance; (2) ordering supplemental maintenance; and (3) finding that he dissipated $26,273 in marital assets. This court affirmed the trial court’s order of permanent maintenance but reversed the trial court’s order capping the supplemental maintenance range at $650,000 and instead capped it at $250,000. As to dissipation, this court affirmed a finding of dissipation of $2,625; we reversed a finding of $5,729; and we remanded for a new hearing to determine whether Bruce dissipated the remaining $17,919 withdrawn from the parties’ joint tax-exempt money-market account. In re Marriage of Schinelli, No. 2 — 07—0617 (2008) (unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23) (Schinelli I).\nOn remand, the trial court entered three orders from which Bruce now appeals. Bruce contends that the trial court erred in (1) awarding Cecily $15,000 in attorney fees for defending the first appeal; (2) finding that he had dissipated $17,919 of marital assets; and (3) entering a “Qualified Domestic Relations Order” (QDRO) that improperly modified the judgment of the dissolution of marriage. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand for additional proceedings.\nThe record in this case is substantial. A great deal of evidence was presented in the trial court. Therefore, only those facts necessary to an understanding of this court’s decision will be set forth below, and the relevant facts will be discussed in the analysis of the issues to which they are pertinent.\nAward of Attorney Fees\nOn August 21, 2008, Cecily filed a petition for contribution of fees and costs incurred in the previous appeal. Cecily sought reimbursement for attorney fees of $30,570.07 and costs of $272.81. The petition was supported by an affidavit from Cecily’s attorney regarding his firm’s fees. The petition was not supported by any affidavit from Cecily. On December 11, 2008, following a hearing, the trial court ordered Bruce to pay $15,000 of Cecily’s attorney fees. The trial court explained that if Bruce had appealed only the issue of supplemental maintenance, he would have prevailed and no contribution to fees would be warranted. However, since Bruce had also appealed the award of permanent maintenance and dissipation, the trial court held that contribution was appropriate.\nOn appeal, Bruce argues that the trial court’s decision to award Cecily $15,000 in attorney fees was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Bruce contends that Cecily failed to show that she had an inability to pay her own fees. Bruce further argues that the trial court erred in determining that Cecily was entitled to a portion of her fees because she substantially prevailed on the first appeal.\nAt the outset, we consider Cecily’s argument that we do not have jurisdiction over Bruce’s first contention. Cecily notes that when the trial court entered its order awarding her attorney fees, the trial court indicated that its order was final. Cecily contends that, because the trial court’s order was final, Bruce should have filed his appeal within 30 days rather than waiting for the trial court to resolve the other postjudgment petitions that had been filed in the case. As Bruce did not, Cecily argues that we may not consider the propriety of the award of attorney fees. In so arguing, Cecily acknowledges that her contention is inconsistent with this court’s decisions in In re Marriage of Alyassir, 335 Ill. App. 3d 998 (2003), and In re Marriage of Duggan, 376 Ill. App. 3d 725 (2007). However, she urges this court to overrule Alyassir and to instead adopt the analysis set forth in the special concurrence in Duggan.\nIn In re Marriage of Gutman, 232 Ill. 2d 145, 151 (2008), our supreme court recently explained:\n“ ‘An order is final and appealable if it terminates the litigation between the parties on the merits or disposes of the rights of the parties, either on the entire controversy or a separate part thereof.’ R.W. Dunteman Co. v. C/G Enterprises, Inc., 181 Ill. 2d 153, 159 (1998). Absent a Rule 304(a) finding, a final order disposing of fewer than all of the claims is not an appealable order and does not become appealable until all of the claims have been resolved. Marsh v. Evangelical Covenant Church of Hinsdale, 138 Ill. 2d 458, 464 (1990). This court has defined a ‘claim’ as ‘any right, liability or matter raised in an action.’ Marsh, 138 Ill. 2d at 465. The rule was meant ‘to discourage piecemeal appeals in the absence of a just reason and to remove the uncertainty which existed when a final judgment was entered on fewer than all of the matters in controversy.’ Marsh, 138 Ill. 2d at 465.”\nHere, the trial court’s order awarding Cecily attorney fees did not include a finding pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 304(a) (eff. Jan. 1, 2006). Thus, pursuant to Gutman, the trial court’s order was not appealable until all of the other claims had been resolved. As Bruce properly filed his notice of appeal after the trial court had resolved all of the claims pending between the parties, this court has jurisdiction over the issue of the award of attorney fees. See Gutman, 232 Ill. 2d at 151. In so ruling, we note that our supreme court’s decision is consistent with our decisions in Alyassir and Duggan. We therefore decline Cecily’s invitation to revisit either of those cases.\nTurning to the merits of Bruce’s first contention, we note that attorney fees are generally the responsibility of the party who incurred the fees. In re Marriage of Cantrell, 314 Ill. App. 3d 623, 630 (2000). Section 508(a) of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act (the Dissolution Act) (750 ILCS 5/508(a) (West 2008)) provides in part:\n“The court from time to time, after due notice and hearing, and after considering the financial resources of the parties, may order any party to pay a reasonable amount for his own or the other party’s costs and attorney’s fees.” 750 ILCS 5/508(a) (West 2008).\nThe propriety of an award of attorney fees is dependent upon a showing by the party seeking them of an inability to pay and the ability of the other spouse to do so. Cantrell, 314 Ill. App. 3d at 630. Although awarding fees rests largely in the trial court’s discretion, such an award will be reversed when the financial circumstances of both parties are substantially similar and the party seeking fees has not shown an inability to pay. In re Marriage of Roth, 99 Ill. App. 3d 679, 686 (1981).\nHere, the trial court abused its discretion in ordering Bruce to pay $15,000 of Cecily’s attorney fees. The record reveals that Bruce earned substantially more than Cecily. He earned approximately $200,000 a year while Cecily earned approximately $30,000 a year. However, in dissolving the parties’ marriage, the trial court attempted to rectify this difference, ordering that Bruce pay Cecily permanent monthly maintenance of $6,692 ($80,304 a year). Thus, considering the combination of Cecily’s annual salary and her maintenance award ($30,000 + $80,000 = $110,000) in conjunction with Bruce’s salary and his maintenance obligations ($200,000 - $80,000 = $120,000), the parties’ financial circumstances were substantially similar. Based on this fact, and because Cecily did not demonstrate that she was unable to pay her attorney fees, the trial court erred in ordering Bruce to pay those fees. See id.\nIn so ruling, we find Cecily’s reliance on In re Marriage of Minear, 181 Ill. 2d 552, 561 (1998), to be misplaced. In that case, the wife had monthly net income of $1,086 and also received monthly maintenance of $500 (for a total of $1,586 a month). The husband’s monthly net income, after making the maintenance payment, was $2,563. At a hearing on her motion to have the husband pay her attorney fees, the wife testified that she could not pay her legal fees and that she could not afford to continue paying $675 in monthly mortgage payments. The trial court subsequently awarded the wife her attorney fees. In this case, Cecily’s maintenance award was substantially higher than the wife’s in Minear. Moreover, unlike the wife in Minear, Cecily did not provide evidence that she could not afford to pay her own legal fees.\nFurther, Cecily acknowledges that her trial counsel pointed out at the hearing that “substantially prevailed” was not a question before the court. Indeed, section 508(a) of the Dissolution Act makes no reference to attorney fees being awarded to the party who substantially prevailed in previous litigation. See 750 ILCS 5/508(a) (West 2008).\nDissipation\nAt the trial on March 1, 2007, Cecily’s attorney questioned Bruce about withdrawals he had made from the parties’ joint USAA tax-exempt money-market account. Bruce testified that he routinely transferred funds from the account to their joint checking account to pay marital bills. As to certain withdrawals, he testified that he did not know why he withdrew the money and did not have any documents to refresh his recollection. The trial court did not allow Bruce’s attorney to question Bruce regarding those withdrawals. At the close of the trial, the trial court found that Bruce had dissipated assets. On appeal, this court reversed a finding of dissipation as to $17,919 and remanded for a new hearing so that Bruce could have the opportunity to present evidence that the expenditures made from the joint money-market account between February 2006 and February 2007 were for marital purposes. We also stated:\n“In so ruling, we note that although Bruce was not able to testify as to the withdrawals during his case-in-chief, there was evidence to rebut a determination that Bruce dissipated any funds. The evidence showed that while the dissolution proceedings were pending and the parties were living apart, Bruce paid household expenses for the marital residence, his own household expenses, and all [of the parties’ son] Ian’s personal and educated-related [sic] expenses. Bruce’s [comprehensive financial statement] showed that his monthly income after deductions was $8,652 and that his total monthly expenses were $10,163. Accordingly, Bruce was operating at a monthly deficit of $1,511. Accordingly, withdrawing funds from the joint money market fund in the amount of $17,919 ($26,273 minus the funds spent on [Bruce’s girlfriend] Gallo and the funds to pay off the joint credit card) over the course of twelve months seems reasonable. A $1,511 monthly deficit over a twelvemonth period results in a total deficit of $18,132, which is approximately the amount withdrawn by Bruce. Bruce testified that the parties’ bills were traditionally paid out of the parties’ joint checking account. He further testified that he routinely transferred funds from the joint money market account to the checking account when the parties’ expenses exceeded the balance in the checking account.” Schinelli I, slip op. at 21-22.\nOn April 27, 2009, on remand, the trial court conducted a hearing. Bruce testified that he had withdrawn a total of $17,919 from the parties’ joint USAA tax-exempt money-market account and then deposited that money in the parties’ joint USAA checking account. These withdrawals and deposits were made on nine occasions. Bruce presented documents that reflected the first eight of the withdrawals and subsequent deposits. He did not have any document that reflected the last withdrawal, of $2,000 on February 9, 2007. However, he testified that he deposited that money into the joint checking account to prevent that account, which had a balance of $799.72 on February 13, 2007, from being overdrawn. (The judgment of dissolution found that the checking account had a value of $2,270 on March 1, 2007.) Bruce also testified that he deposited over $6,000 from one of his personal accounts into the joint checking account.\nAs to withdrawals from the checking account, Bruce introduced into evidence the checking account statements. These statements detailed every deposit and every ATM, check, transfer, or debit-card withdrawal after the deposits from the money-market account were made. Bruce testified regarding the withdrawals. Bruce testified that from January 2006 through March 2007, he was primarily responsible for paying household expenses for the former marital residence in Naperville. The expenses were paid using electronic transfers from either his personal USAA checking account or the joint USAA checking account. He paid Cecily’s housing expenses with the joint USAA checking account. Between January 2006 and March 2007, in addition to Cecily’s household expenses, he paid the expenses of establishing his own residence, his general living expenses (gas, food, and clothes), and his son Ian’s personal and college expenses. In 2006 and early 2007, Ian’s college expenses, for Belmont University in Tennessee, cost about $2,700 a month.\nDuring the time frame at issue, Bruce’s monthly gross earnings were $16,717. His monthly expenses for both households and Ian’s schooling were over $10,000. The parties had a joint USAA credit card which both of them used in 2006. He paid the credit card bill in full each month through one of the two accounts. He and Cecily each had a debit card for the joint USAA checking account, which he used occasionally in 2006 through early 2007. Most of the debit transactions were hers. Bruce testified that this was apparent because most of the transactions occurred close to where Cecily lived in Naperville. He lived in Wheeling. Bruce testified that he transferred funds occasionally from the joint USAA tax-exempt money-market account into the joint USAA checking account to cover living expenses over and above their incomes.\nCecily testified that from January 2006 through March 2007 she lived at the former marital residence. She worked at Oak Consulting in Lisle and her pay was directly deposited twice a month into the joint USAA checking account. Her monthly net income from her employment was $1,048. Her mortgage, utility, food, and other household expenses totaled $3,330 and were paid by Bruce. He paid the real estate taxes from the joint checking account. She paid the monthly cable and cell phone bills from the joint checking account. Her personal expenses of $711 per month and clothing expenses were charged to the parties’ joint USAA credit card. The joint USAA credit card bill was paid from their joint checking account. Her monthly miscellaneous expenses totaled $804 and were also paid from the joint checking account.\nCecily acknowledged that she traveled to Florida in January 2006, Tennessee in November 2006, and Las Vegas in December 2006. None of the trips were work-related. She used the joint credit card while she was on those trips. She also acknowledged that she had used the joint checking account to make payments to her attorneys. (The record reveals that Cecily used the joint credit card to pay her attorneys $5,079.51 between January 2006 and February 2007.) She further acknowledged that she made ATM withdrawals from the joint checking account. (The record indicates that she made withdrawals of $1,409.95.)\nAt the close of the hearing, the trial court ruled that Bruce had failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that he had not dis sipated marital assets from the joint checking account. The trial court explained:\n“The Appellate Court did specifically say, Counsel, that you were supposed to prove by clear and convincing evidence how the money went. I don’t have any canceled checks showing what he paid, I don’t have anything. I looked — I can clearly see that he made — he put money into the account. That’s clear. I understand how much he was putting into the account.\nBut he was retaining the rest of the money that he earned. You offered not one piece of evidence today that showed what bills he paid with the remainder of his money: No lease, no rent, no expenses, no car, no gas, no dental bills, nothing that you offered into evidence today.\nI do think that clearly he did transfer money into the account. I saw that. When his income went up to the $200,000, it didn’t appear that his deposits into this account went up.\nI have to look at the amount of money that he was retaining over and above what he was putting in before, he kept it at the same amount, and then he didn’t account for how he spent the rest of the money.\nI don’t think you met the burden that the Court required of you to meet. I thought it was really clear, and I expected to get that evidence in today, and I didn’t get one piece of it.\n* * *\nThe remaining seventeen nine one nine, I still find it to be dissipation, I still find that you failed to meet your burden by clear and convincing evidence to show how the funds were spent, not that they weren’t deposited, I understand they were deposited.”\nIn Schinelli I, this court explained:\n“Dissipation has been defined as the use of marital property for the sole benefit of one of the spouses for a purpose unrelated to the marriage at a time when the marriage is undergoing an irreconcilable breakdown. In re Marriage of Vancura, 356 Ill. App. 3d 200, 203 (2005). The determination of whether dissipation occurred in a given case is reviewed using the manifest weight of the evidence standard of review. Vancura, 356 Ill. App. 3d at 204. The general principle is that the person charged with the dissipation is under an obligation to establish by clear and convincing evidence how the funds were spent. Vancura, 356 Ill. App. 3d at 204. General statements that funds were spent on marital expenses or to pay bills are inadequate to avoid a finding of dissipation. In re Marriage of Petrovich, 154 Ill. App. 3d 881, 886 (1987).” Schinelli I, slip op. at 16.\nWe believe that the trial court erred in finding that Bruce had dissipated assets from the joint checking account. In Schinelli I, we remanded for the trial court to conduct a new hearing on whether Bruce had dissipated $17,919 from the joint checking account and to allow him to present evidence on that issue. Although the trial court conducted a hearing and allowed Bruce to present evidence of how funds in the joint checking account had been spent, the trial court’s ruling was unrelated to the evidence presented. Instead, the trial court essentially found that Bruce should have been paying the family’s bills with one of his individual accounts rather than the joint account. That was improper. See In re Marriage of Davis, 215 Ill. App. 3d 763, 778 (1991) (although husband had other funds available to him, he was not required to use those funds, before using marital funds, for family purposes).\nAs we noted in Schinelli I, when Bruce was allegedly dissipating marital assets, he was paying household expenses for the marital residence, his own household expenses, and all of Ian’s personal and education-related expenses. These substantial expenses caused Bruce to incur a monthly deficit of $1,511. At the hearing on remand, Bruce testified that the parties’ bills were traditionally paid out of the parties’ joint checking account. At that same hearing, the parties’ statements from the joint checking account were introduced into evidence. Bruce testified in detail regarding the transactions and whether he or Cecily had made each transaction and why it had been made. Bruce further testified that he deposited over $6,000 from one of his individual accounts into the joint checking account. Based on the evidence adduced at the original trial in conjunction with the evidence presented at the hearing on remand, the record shows that Bruce established by clear and convincing evidence that he did not dissipate marital assets. The trial court’s finding to the contrary was therefore against the manifest weight of the evidence.\nIn so ruling, we reject Cecily’s argument that Bruce presented only vague and general testimony as to how the funds were spent. We believe that Bruce’s testimony and other evidence sufficiently set forth how the funds from the parties’ joint checking account were spent. We also reject Cecily’s argument that Bruce essentially admitted that he dissipated $816.50 that he withdrew by ATM and $2,119.99 that he paid to his attorneys. The record reveals that during the time frame at issue, Cecily paid her attorneys fees of $5,079.51. She made ATM withdrawals of $1,409.95. She also used the joint checking account to pay expenses incurred on personal trips to Florida, Tennessee, and Las Vegas. As such, Cecily was making the same types of withdrawals from the joint checking account that she criticizes Bruce for making. Based on these circumstances, we believe that it would be inequitable to find that Bruce dissipated assets and to overlook Cecily’s similar conduct.\nQualified Domestic Relations Order\nIn its judgment of dissolution on March 16, 2007, the trial court evenly divided the parties’ retirement assets. The trial court awarded each party his or her own retirement assets. The one exception was Bruce’s Wachovia 401(k) account. The trial court divided that asset so that the overall division of the marital retirement assets would be equal. Specifically, the trial court’s order provided:\nAsset\nTTX Thrift Plan\nWachovia 401(k)\nWachovia Deferred Comp.\nSchwab IRA\nSchwab IRA\nSchwab IRA\nOak Consultants 401(k)\nTotal\nEquity\n$5,418\n$309,423\n$62,665\n$49,128\n$27,732\n$27,118\n$66,670\n$548,224\nBruce\n$5,418\n$156,901\n$62,665\n$49,128\n0\n0\n0\n$274,112\nCecily\n0\n$152,522\n0\n0\n$27,732\n$27,118\n$66,670\n$274,112\nOn November 18, 2008, Cecily filed a motion for a QDRO based on the dissolution order. She requested that $152,522 be transferred from the Wachovia 401(k) account to her. Bruce filed a written objection, stating that the value of the plan had dropped drastically due to market conditions. He therefore argued that a transfer to Cecily of the amount originally ordered was no longer appropriate.\nOn April 27, 2009, the trial court conducted a hearing on Cecily’s motion. The evidence established that as of March 31, 2009, the Wachovia 401(k) account had a value of $179,830. In response to comments by the parties as to its intent in dividing the retirement accounts, the trial court explained:\n“I added them all up, divided them by two. She kept hers, he kept his, except for the 40 IK for him, he would have to roll over money into her. So that, when they all ended up at the bottom, they had the same amount.\n* * *\nThe Wachovia 40 IK was the vehicle designated to be the one that money would come out of his so that, when it went into hers, they would each have the same total for all of their accounts.”\nBruce’s attorney argued that Cecily’s QDRO should be for half of what the Wachovia 401(k) was currently worth. The trial court questioned whether it could reevaluate one of the parties’ retirement accounts without reevaluating all of the other retirement accounts that had been divided. Cecily’s attorney argued that the dissolution order provided that she was to receive $152,522 from the Wachovia 401(k); thus, that is the amount she should receive. At the close of the hearing, the trial court ordered that $152,522 (84.8% of the Wachovia 401(k) account’s value) be awarded to Cecily.\nOn appeal, Bruce argues that the trial court erred in entering a QDRO that improperly modified the dissolution order. Bruce contends that the trial court’s dissolution order intended that the parties’ retirement assets be divided equally between them. However, the effect of the QDRO was to award Cecily an additional $125,000. Bruce insists that the QDRO was improper because it caused him to bear all of the loss that the Wachovia 401(k) account suffered between March 2007 and March 2009. Bruce maintains that, in entering the QDRO, the trial court should have divided the Wachovia 401(k) account loss between them in a way that was consistent with its judgment of dissolution.\nJudgments may be construed like other written instruments. In re Marriage of Breslow, 306 Ill. App. 3d 41, 57 (1999). For instance, although an unambiguous judgment must be enforced as drafted, an ambiguous judgment may be read in conjunction with the entire record and construed in accordance therewith. Id.\nHere, the problem with the dissolution order is not that it is ambiguous; the problem is that it is unenforceable. The dissolution order unambiguously provided that Bruce was to receive $156,901 from the Wachovia 401(k) account and that Cecily was to receive $152,522 from the Wachovia 401(k) account. When the trial court entered the QDRO on April 27, 2009, the dissolution order was impossible to comply with because the Wachovia 401(k) account was worth only $179,830. We therefore believe that the trial court’s resolution of this issue — to have Bruce bear all the loss that the Wachovia 401(k) account incurred — is both unfair and contrary to the judgment of dissolution. Accordingly, the trial court’s decision must be reversed.\nIn arguing that she should nonetheless receive the full $152,522, despite the diminution in the Wachovia 401(k) account, Cecily relies on In re Marriage of Carrier, 332 Ill. App. 3d 654 (2002). We find Cecily’s reliance on that case to be misplaced. In Carrier, the parties had a marital settlement agreement that provided that the wife would receive $725,000 from the husband’s individual retirement account (IRA) via a QDRO. Prior to the entry of the dissolution judgment, the trial court conducted a proveup of the settlement agreement. At the proveup, the husband testified that he understood that the wife was to receive $725,000 from his IRA regardless of whether the market value of the account rose or fell following the entry of the dissolution judgment. On June 14, 2000, the trial court entered a judgment of dissolution that was consistent with the parties’ marital settlement agree ment. On November 27, 2000, the wife filed a petition for a rule to show cause, alleging that the husband had failed to transfer to her the $725,000. On February 21, 2001, the trial court conducted a hearing on the wife’s petition. Several correspondences between the parties were introduced that indicated that, until September 28, 2000, the wife had taken on the responsibility to effectuate the transfer from the IRA. The husband testified that the account was currently worth $120,000 less than it was when the parties’ marriage was dissolved. The husband also testified that he believed the parties were to divide the IRA on a percentage ratio. Thus, because the value of the account had gone down, he asserted that the value of the wife’s share had also decreased. At the close of the hearing, the trial court found that for the period between September 1, 2000, and September 28, 2000, each of the parties should assume a proportion of the loss in accordance with his or her ratio of interest. Id. at 655-57. On appeal, this court vacated the trial court’s decision. Id. at 662. We found that the marital settlement agreement unambiguously stated that the wife was to receive $725,000. Because the marital settlement agreement did not indicate that the wife’s award from the IRA was to be based on a percentage or to be affected by subsequent fluctuations in market value, we held that the trial court erred in ruling that the wife’s share of the IRA was affected by the change in the market value of the account between the dissolution judgment and the date of transfer. Id. at 658. In a dissent, one justice wrote the trial court’s decision allocating the market losses between the parties should be affirmed. Id. at 662 (O’Malley, J., dissenting). The dissent explained that because the wife was responsible for the transfer of the funds during a certain time frame, “it would be patently unfair to saddle [the husband] with the loss incurred during that period of time.” Id. at 663 (O’Malley, J., dissenting).\nHere, unlike in Carrier, the parties did not have a marital settlement agreement that divided their marital assets. As such, unlike the husband in Carrier, Bruce never agreed that Cecily would receive a fixed amount from the retirement account at issue. Rather, the parties’ retirement assets were divided by the trial court. In the absence of any marital settlement agreement providing that Cecily would receive a set amount, we believe that it would be patently unfair to saddle one of the parties with all of the losses incurred in the Wachovia 401(k) account. Accordingly, as stated above, we believe that the trial court erred in allocating all of that loss to Bruce.\nCecily insists that the trial court’s decision may nonetheless be affirmed because Bruce failed to introduce evidence as to whether the value of the other retirement assets had fluctuated. Relying on In re Marriage of Brenner, 235 Ill. App. 3d 840, 848 (1992), Cecily contends that the trial court was obligated to reevaluate all of the retirement assets in order to ensure that they were properly divided. Because Bruce did not present the value of the other assets, Cecily argues that he has forfeited his right to any relief.\nGenerally, if a property division is reversed based on an improper valuation, then the proper remedy is to reverse the property settlement in the judgment and remand the case for reevaluation and redivision of all the marital assets. In re Marriage of Rubinstein, 145 Ill. App. 3d 31, 38 (1986). The parties to a dissolution must provide the trial court with sufficient evidence of property value. Brenner, 235 Ill. App. 3d at 848. A reviewing court will not reverse and remand where the parties had adequate opportunity to present evidence but failed to do so. Id.\nHere, we do not believe that the trial court had to reevaluate any of the parties’ assets other than the Wachovia 401(k) account. In Rubinstein, at issue was the trial court’s improper determination of the value of the husband’s medical practice. Rubinstein, 145 Ill. App. 3d at 38. That determination necessarily impacted the division of the parties’ other marital assets as well as the amount of support that the husband should pay the wife. In this case, neither the trial court nor the parties indicated that the division of the Wachovia 401(k) account had any impact on the division of the parties’ marital estate other than how the parties’ retirement assets were distributed. Indeed, Cecily does not fault Bruce because he failed to present evidence of all of the parties’ marital assets; she faults him only because he did not present evidence of the current value of the parties’ retirement assets that had previously been divided.\nBased upon how the retirement assets were divided, however, we do not believe that the trial court was obligated to reassess those assets. In its order of dissolution on March 16, 2007, the trial court awarded Cecily a 100% interest in three accounts that had a total value of $121,520. The trial court awarded Bruce a 100% interest in three accounts that had a total value of $117,211. Thus, excluding the Wachovia 401(k) account, the trial court awarded Cecily 50.9% of the retirement accounts and Bruce 49.1% of those accounts. As such, the trial court essentially awarded each party an equal amount of the retirement accounts.\nAs the parties were awarded these accounts upon the entry of the judgment of dissolution, they were then able to manage the accounts as conservatively or aggressively as they wanted. Thus, the parties were given the ability to minimize their accounts’ losses during the stock market decline that occurred in 2008. This was markedly differ ent from the situation with the Wachovia 401(k) account. Because that account was subject to a QDRO, neither party could exercise any discretion over that account until the first appeal was resolved.\nWe believe that if the trial court were obligated to reconsider the value of the other retirement accounts before it addressed how the Wachovia 401(k) losses should be allocated, it would lead to a potentially unfair result. If the other accounts were considered, the party who managed his or her accounts better during the market decline would have to subsidize the party who incurred more losses with his or her investment strategy in order to ensure that the accounts continued to be divided equally. As this would be improper, contrary to Cecily’s assertion, Bruce was under no obligation to provide the trial court with evidence as to whether the retirement assets previously distributed had fluctuated in value.\nFinally, we note that in dividing the Wachovia 401(k) account, the trial court’s March 16, 2007, dissolution order had the effect of awarding 50.7% of the Wachovia 401(k) account to Bruce and 49.3% of the account to Cecily. As the trial court’s QDRO of April 27, 2009, was not consistent with the order of dissolution, we reverse the QDRO. On remand, the trial court shall enter a QDRO consistent with its dissolution order, awarding 50.7% of the Wachovia 401(k) account to Bruce and 49.3% of the account to Cecily. The value of the Wachovia 401(k) account shall be based on what it would currently be worth had it not been divided on April 27, 2009.\nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court of Du Page County is reversed and the cause is remanded for additional proceedings consistent with this decision.\nReversed and remanded with directions.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

At issue is whether plaintiffs or Bridgeview had priority in their claims against an aircraft originally owned by defendant Fasti USA, Inc. (Fasti). The trial court effectively determined that Bridge-view, whose claim against the plane predated plaintiffs’ claims by several years, was not required to file a continuation statement with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to maintain the perfection of its claim. Therefore, Bridgeview’s claim retained its priority. We affirm.\nI. BACKGROUND\nAround May 2001, Bridgeview loaned money to Fasti. In return, Bridgeview received a promissory note and a security agreement giv ing it a security interest in a 1979 Cessna aircraft that Fasti owned. On July 9, 2001, Bridgeview recorded the security agreement with the FAA. Fasti breached the security agreement on August 18, 2008, and Bridgeview repossessed the plane on October 7, 2008. On April 8, 2009, Bridgeview issued a notice to plaintiffs, among others, of a private Uniform Commercial Code (810 ILCS 5/1 — 101 et seq. (West 2008)) sale of the aircraft, to take place on April 20, 2009. Royal Palm purchased the plane, and the bill of sale was recorded with the FAA on June 22, 2009.\nMeanwhile, on February 14, 2005, plaintiffs filed a lien statement with the FAA for $55,000 worth of work they had completed on the plane for Fasti by December 30, 2004. On October 1, 2008, plaintiffs filed a lien statement with the FAA for $36,272.68 worth of work they had completed on the plane for Fasti by September 11, 2008.\nOn September 10, 2009, plaintiffs filed a complaint to foreclose on their liens. The complaint contained six counts. Counts I through III related to the $36,272.68 lien. Count I was directed against all three defendants and sought a judgment foreclosing the lien; count II was directed against Bridgeview and sought an accounting; and count III was directed against Fasti and alleged breach of contract. Counts IV through VI related to the $55,000 lien. Count IV was directed against all three defendants and sought a judgment foreclosing the lien; count V was directed against Bridgeview and sought an accounting; and count VI was directed against Fasti and alleged breach of contract.\nBridgeview filed a motion to dismiss on October 22, 2009. Bridge-view sought to dismiss counts I and IV of plaintiffs’ complaint, pursuant to section 2 — 619 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) (735 ILCS 5/2 — 619 (West 2008)). It argued, inter alia, that its security interest had priority over plaintiffs’ lien claims. Bridgeview further sought to dismiss counts II and V pursuant to section 2 — 615 of the Code (735 ILCS 5/2 — 615 (West 2008)), arguing that plaintiffs failed to state a claim for an accounting because they did not allege that they had an inadequate remedy at law. On December 28, 2009, the trial court granted Bridgeview’s motion and dismissed the counts against it. It further sua sponte dismissed counts I and IV as to Royal Palm and Fasti. The trial court included language under Supreme Court Rule 304(a) (Ill. S. Ct. R. 304(a) (eff. Jan. 1, 2006)) that there was no reason to delay the enforcement or appeal of the order. Plaintiffs timely appealed.\nII. ANALYSIS\nOn appeal, plaintiffs challenge the trial court’s grant of Bridge-view’s motion to dismiss. In reviewing the grant of a section 2 — 619 motion, we must interpret the pleadings and supporting materials in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Abruzzo v. City of Park Ridge, 231 Ill. 2d 324, 332 (2008). A section 2 — 619 dismissal resembles the grant of a motion for summary judgment; we must determine whether a genuine issue of material fact should have precluded the dismissal or, absent such an issue of fact, whether the dismissal was proper as a matter of law. Raintree Homes, Inc. v. Village of Long Grove, 209 Ill. 2d 248, 254 (2004). A section 2 — 615 motion to dismiss attacks the legal sufficiency of the complaint. We must determine whether the allegations, when construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, sufficiently state a cause of action upon which relief can be granted. Turner v. Memorial Medical Center, 233 Ill. 2d 494, 499 (2009). A cause of action should not be dismissed under section 2 — 615 unless no set of facts can be proved entitling the plaintiff to recover. Id. We review de novo the grant of a motion to dismiss under either section 2 — 615 or section 2 — 619. Westfield Insurance Co. v. Birkey’s Farm Store, Inc., 399 Ill. App. 3d 219, 231 (2010).\nThis case further requires us to interpret statutes. The primary rule of statutory construction is to give effect to the legislature’s intent, which is best determined by the statutory language’s plain and ordinary meaning. Solon v. Midwest Medical Records Ass’n, 236 Ill. 2d 433, 440 (2010). We will not read into the language any exceptions, limitations, or conditions that conflict with the expressed intent. Id. at 441. Statutory construction presents a question of law, which we review de novo. Id. at 439.\nPlaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in finding that Bridgeview was not required to file a continuation statement with the FAA to maintain perfection of its security interest in the aircraft. Federal law requires that every aircraft transfer be evidenced by an instrument recorded with the FAA before the rights of innocent third parties can be affected. 49 U.S.C. §§44107, 44108 (2006); Philko Aviation, Inc. v. Shacket, 462 U.S. 406, 409-10 (1983). Section 44107 of the Federal Aviation Administration Act requires the FAA’s administrator to establish a system for recording, among other things, “conveyances that affect an interest in civil aircraft of the United States.” 49 U.S.C. §44107(a)(1) (2006). “Conveyance” is defined as “an instrument, including a conditional sales contract, affecting title to, or an interest in, property.” 49 U.S.C. §40102(a)(19) (2006). Section 44108 of the Federal Aviation Administration Act provides in relevant part:\n“(a) Validity Before Filing. — Until a conveyance, lease, or instrument executed for security purposes that may be recorded under section 44107(a)(1) or (2) of this title is filed for recording, the conveyance, lease, or instrument is valid only against—\n(1) the person making the conveyance, lease, or instrument;\n(2) that person’s heirs and devisees; and\n(3) a person having actual notice of the conveyance, lease, or instrument.\n(b) Period of Validity. — When a conveyance, lease, or instrument is recorded under section 44107 of this title, the conveyance, lease, or instrument is valid from the date of filing against all persons, without other recordation, except that [exceptions not applicable.]\n* * *\n(c) Applicable Laws. — (1) The validity of a conveyance, lease, or instrument that may be recorded under section 44107 of this title is subject to the laws of the State, the District of Columbia, or the territory or possession of the United States at which the conveyance, lease, or instrument is delivered, regardless of the place at which the subject of the conveyance, lease, or instrument is located or delivered.” (Emphasis added.) 49 U.S.C. §44108 (2006).\nThe federal registration process was designed to create a central clearing house to record titles so that everyone has easy access to claims, liens, or legal interests in a civilian aircraft. Philko Aviation, Inc., 462 U.S. at 411. Therefore, in creating the registration system, Congress intended that it “preempt any state law under which a transfer without a recordable conveyance would be valid against innocent transferees or lienholders who have recorded.” Id. at 410. In this case, it is undisputed that Bridgeview properly recorded its security interest in Fasti’s aircraft on July 9, 2001.\nPlaintiffs rely on Illinois’s Uniform Commercial Code (Commercial Code) (810 ILCS 5/1 — 101 et seq. (West 2008)). The Commercial Code requires the in-state filing of a financing statement to perfect a security interest, but this requirement does not apply to, among others, “property subject to a statute, regulation, or treaty described in Section 9 — 311(a).” 810 ILCS 5/9 — 310(b)(3) (West 2008). Section 9 — 311(a)(1) provides in relevant part:\n“(a) Security interest subject to other law. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) [not applicable here], the filing of a financing statement is not necessary or effective to perfect a security interest in property subject to:\n(1) a statute, regulation, or treaty of the United States whose requirements for a security interest’s obtaining priority over the rights of a hen creditor with respect to property preempt Section 9 — 310(a)[.]” 810 ILCS 5/9 — 311(a)(1) (West 2008).\nThus, the Commercial Code also recognizes that any federal statutory requirements would prevail for perfecting a security interest in property, and the Commercial Code exempts parties with such security interests from its filing requirements. In fact, the official comments to section 9 — 311 specifically mention the registry for civilian aircrafts as an example of the type of federal statute referred to in subsection (a)(1). 810 ILCS Ann. 5/9 — 311, Uniform Commercial Code Comment, at 510 (Smith-Hurd 2004).\nPlaintiffs do not dispute that under Illinois law Bridgeview’s security interest originally had priority over their liens due to Bridgeview’s earlier perfection of its security interest. See 770 ILCS 45/4 (West 2008) (lien “shall be subject to the lien of any bona fide security interest as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code upon the same chattel recorded prior to the commencement of any lien herein created”). Rather, plaintiffs argue that Bridgeview was required under the Commercial Code to file a continuation statement with the FAA to maintain perfection of its security interest and that its failure to do so resulted in plaintiffs’ liens having priority. Section 9 — 515 of the Commercial Code provides that a filed financing statement is effective for five years and that a continuation statement must be filed for the financing statement to remain effective for another five years. 810 ILCS 5/9 — 515 (West 2008). However, section 9 — 311(c) of the Commercial Code provides that “duration and renewal of perfection of a security interest perfected by compliance with the requirements prescribed by a statute, regulation, or treaty described in subsection (a) are governed by the statute, regulation, or treaty.” (Emphasis added.) 810 ILCS 5/9 — 311(c) (West 2008). Thus, in addition to the Supreme Court’s holding that federal law preempts state law in the area of recording a security interest in a civilian aircraft, the Commercial Code expressly defers to federal law on the subject of the duration and renewal of perfection of a security interest. As stated, section 44108, governing filing with the FAA, states that “[w]hen a conveyance, lease, or instrument is recorded under section 44107 of this title, the conveyance, lease, or instrument is valid from the date of filing *** without other recordation.” (Emphasis added.) 49 U.S.C. §44108(b) (2006). Accordingly, we agree with defendants that under the unambiguous language of the relevant statutes, Bridgeview was not required to file a continuation statement to maintain the perfection of its security interest in the aircraft.\nPlaintiffs argue that federal law does not absolutely preempt state law concerning interests in an aircraft. Plaintiffs note that priority is determined under state law (see Philko, 462 U.S. at 412-13 (all interests in aircraft “must be federally recorded before they can obtain whatever priority to which they are entitled under state law”) ), as is validity (see 49 U.S.C. §44108(c) (2006) (the “validity of a conveyance, lease, or instrument that may be recorded under section 44107 *** is subject to the laws of the State *** at which the conveyance, lease, or instrument is delivered”)). Plaintiffs argue that a dispute over whether a continuation statement needs to be filed by a party with an interest in a civilian aircraft for that party to maintain perfection is a “priority” dispute. Plaintiffs argue that although section 9 — 311(c) of the Commercial Code provides that the “duration and renewal” of a security interest perfected under a federal statute is governed under that statute, section 44108 is silent as to duration and renewal, so that subject would still be governed by state law, which requires the filing of a continuation statement. Plaintiffs maintain that all that is meant by section 44108’s language that an “instrument is valid from the date of filing against all persons, without other recordation” is that: (1) the date of filing, rather than the date the FAA actually records the instrument, determines the date of perfection, and (2) an instrument filed with the FAA need not also be filed with a state or local recording office.\nPlaintiffs’ argument is without merit. The necessity of a continuation statement is a question not of priority, as plaintiffs characterize it, but rather of maintaining the perfection of a recorded security interest. Even if the phrase “without other recordation” in section 44108 is construed to mean that an instrument does not need to be filed with a state or local recording office, the Commercial Code indisputably defers to federal law on the subject of the “duration and renewal of perfection of a security interest” in an aircraft (810 ILCS 5/9 — 311(c) (West 2008)), and section 44108 still provides that an “instrument is valid from the date of filing against all persons,” without listing any applicable exceptions (49 U.S.C. §44108 (2006)). To revert to the Commercial Code on the issue of a continuation statement would be reading into both the federal and the state statutes exceptions and conditions that do not exist, contrary to the rules of statutory construction. Thus, once Bridgeview filed its security inter est with the FAA, the interest was perfected without the need to renew or extend its duration.\nPlaintiffs’ reliance on In re Brice, 188 F.3d 576 (4th Cir. 1999), does not compel a different result. In that case, two creditors received security interests in the same aircraft in exchange for loans. As in this case, the junior creditor, Thomas Blair, argued that the senior creditor, Crestar Bank, had forfeited its priority because it failed to file a continuation statement with the FAA five years after it filed its initial security agreement. Id. at 577. In addition to a statute requiring a continuation statement, Virginia had a statute similar to section 9 — 311 of the Commercial Code which provided that “ ‘[djuration and renewal of perfection of a security interest perfected by compliance with the statute or treaty [of the United States] are governed by the provisions of the statute or treaty.’ ” Id. at 578 n.4 (quoting Va. Code Ann. §8.9 — 302(4) (Michie 1991)). The bankruptcy court held that section 44107 of the Federal Aviation Administration Act preempted the state law requiring a continuation statement and that therefore Crestar Bank was not required to file such a statement with the FAA. The district court affirmed. Id. at 577. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals also affirmed, though on a different basis. It relied on section 55 — 100 of the Virginia Code, which provided:\n“ ‘No instrument which affects the title to or interest in any civil aircraft of the United States, as defined by federal law, ... shall be valid ... until such instrument is recorded in the office of the Civil Aeronautic[s] Administrator of the United States, or such other office as is designated by the laws of the United States as the one in which such instruments should be filed. Every such instrument so recorded in such office shall be valid as to all persons without further recordation in any office in this Commonwealth, the provisions of any other recordation statute to the contrary notwithstanding.’ ” (Emphasis added.) Id. at 578 n.5 (quoting Va. Code Ann. §55 — 100 (Michie 1995)).\nThe court of appeals held that section 55 — 100 applied because the security interest concerned an aircraft registered with the FAA, and under section 55 — 100, no further recordation was required after the initial FAA filing. Id. at 579.\nPlaintiffs argue that since the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals analyzed the issue under state law and relied on a statute not present in Illinois, it is reasonable to conclude that the court believed that the bank would not have otherwise been exempt from filing a continuation statement. However, in choosing to affirm the lower courts’ decisions on a different basis, the court of appeals neither rejected nor accepted their analysis. Furthermore, the court of appeals interpreted the phrase “without further recordation” in section 55 — 100 as not requiring additional recordation beyond the initial recordation with the FAA, and this phrase is almost the same as section 44108(b)’s statement that a security agreement is valid from the date of filing “without other recordation.”\nBased on the plain reading of the relevant statutes, Bridgeview’s security interest in the aircraft remained perfected upon its initial recordation and retained its priority over plaintiffs’ later-recorded liens. When Bridgeview sold the plane to Royal Palm, plaintiffs’ liens on the plane were extinguished. See 810 ILCS 5/9 — 617(a)(3) (West 2008) (“[a] secured party’s disposition of collateral after default *** discharges any subordinate security interest or other subordinate lien”). Therefore, the trial court properly granted Bridgeview’s motion to dismiss counts I and IV Plaintiffs’ arguments requesting a reversal of the dismissal of counts II and V are also premised on the position that Bridgeview’s perfection of its security interest lapsed due to the lack of a continuation statement. In rejecting this position, we affirm the dismissal of counts II and V as well. The remaining counts, counts III and VI, alleged breach of contract against Fasti and are not before us on appeal. Based on our resolution of the issues, we need not address defendants’ argument that plaintiffs’ liens were invalid because they were filed with the FAA rather than in the county in which the work was done. See 770 ILCS 45/2 (West 2008).\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court of Kane County.\nAffirmed.\nFor purposes of this appeal, we do not differentiate between Travel Express Aviation Maintenance, Inc., and Travel Express Aviation, LLC.\nThe Philko court used the example that a party recording its interest with the FAA may still not have an enforceable interest in the plane if the instrument evidencing the transfer to the party did not comply with formal requisites of state law. Philko, 462 U.S. at 414 n.8; see also In re Gary Aircraft Corp., 681 F.2d 365, 372-75 (5th Cir. 1982) (although holder of security interest recorded with the FAA its interest in two planes before the subsequent purchaser did, purchaser was a buyer in the ordinary course of business under Texas law and therefore bought the planes free of the security interest).&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

Wisniewski asserted claims against the Diocese for negligence, wilful and wanton conduct, fraud and deceit, and civil conspiracy. Wisniewski alleged that the Diocese knew that Kownacki had molested other children at other parishes before transferring him to St. Theresa’s school and church in Salem, Illinois. On August 27, 2008, a jury awarded Wisniewski $2.4 million in compensatory damages and $2.6 million in punitive damages, and the circuit court entered a judgment upon the jury’s verdict. The Diocese timely filed a notice of appeal of the circuit court’s judgment. On appeal, the Diocese argues the following: (I) that Wisniewski’s claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations and statute of repose, (II) that Wisniewski’s claims were insufficient as a matter of law, (III) that the circuit court abused its discretion in denying the Diocese’s motion for a mental examination of Wisniewski under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 215 (eff. July 1, 2002), and (IV) that the circuit court abused its discretion in striking certain references from the records and testimony of one of Wisniewski’s witnesses. The Diocese does not claim that the verdict is excessive. For the following reasons, we affirm.\nBACKGROUND\nThe Diocese is a religious not-for-profit corporation that ministers to more than 100,000 Catholics in the southernmost 28 counties of the State of Illinois. The Diocese includes approximately 116 parishes, 26 or 27 Catholic grade schools, and 3 high schools, and it employs approximately 140 priests. The Diocese has four officers: the bishop serves as the president or CEO of the not-for-profit corporation, the vicar general serves as the vice president, the chancellor serves as the secretary, and the chief financial officer serves as the treasurer. The vicar general is second in the Diocese’s chain of command and serves as the alter ego of the bishop in the administrative affairs of the Diocese. The chancellor of the Diocese is responsible for keeping the archives, records, and official Diocese files, including personnel files. The Diocese also employs a vice-chancellor, who works as an archivist and an ecclesiastical notary but is not an officer of the not-for-profit corporation. The Diocese employs a secretary for the bishop, whose duties include keeping track of the bishop’s appointments, typing letters for the bishop, serving as the bishop’s driver, and visiting the various parishes in the Diocese with the bishop. The bishop, the bishop’s secretary, the vicar general, the chancellor, and the vice-chancellor all work together in a building called the chancery, which is located in Belleville, Illinois.\nAt the trial, Wisniewski presented evidence that, when he was a young boy growing up in Salem, Illinois, he and his family were parishioners of St. Theresa’s parish located in Salem. Beginning in 1973, when he was 12 years old, Wisniewski endured repeated incidents of sexual molestation by a priest employed by the Diocese. The molestation occurred over a number of years. The priest was Raymond F. Kownacki, and at the trial, the Diocese did not deny that Kownacki committed the acts of sexual abuse described by Wisniewski. Wisniewski’s claim against the Diocese is based on the assertion that the Diocese was responsible for the molestation he endured because the Diocese knew that Kownacki had molested other children at other parishes before it transferred Kownacki to St. Theresa’s parish in Salem. An analysis of Wisniewski’s claim against the Diocese requires a consideration of events that occurred while Kownacki was in Salem and a consideration of events that occurred during the years before and after Kownacki came to Salem. We review the facts presented at the trial in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. Quality Granite Construction Co. v. Hurst-Rosche Engineers, Inc., 261 Ill. App. 3d 21, 24, 632 N.E.2d 1139, 1141 (1994).\nI.\nThe Diocese’s Knowledge of Kownacki’s History of Child Sexual Abuse\nKownacki was born December 8, 1934, and he was first ordained as a priest in the Catholic Church on June 4, 1960. Kownacki served the Catholic Church at various locations after he was ordained, including O’Fallon and East St. Louis, Illinois, and Guatemala. The record contains little information concerning the earliest years of Kownacki’s ministry. On December 9, 1970, the Diocese appointed Kownacki as the priest of a parish in the small town of St. Francisville, Illinois. At St. Francisville, Kownacki met a young girl at the parish named Gina Parks. On June 8, 1971, the Diocese transferred Kownacki to St. Martin of Tours parish in Washington Park, Illinois.\nSometime in 1973, the Diocese became aware of allegations that Kownacki had sexually abused Gina. At that time, the bishop of the Diocese was Albert R. Zuroweste and the Diocese’s chancellor was Monsignor Bernard Sullivan. Sullivan, the Diocese’s records keeper, had the habit of taking extensive notes of each of his telephone conversations and meetings. On April 24, 1973, Bishop Zuroweste, Chancellor Sullivan, and another priest, Dean Braun, met with Gina Parks and her family at the chancery to discuss abuse Kownacki perpetrated against Gina. As was his custom, Sullivan took extensive handwritten notes during that meeting, and he transcribed his handwritten notes three days later.\nThe first two paragraphs of Sullivan’s April 27, 1973, typed notes detailed allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct involving Kownacki that the Diocese had previously received notice of and that were in addition to the abuse reported by Gina and her parents on April 24, 1973. Sullivan’s notes began as follows:\n“Last year complaint from man in Guatemala that you [Kownacki] were sleeping with his daughter and she was pregnant by you. We accepted explanation that this man was jealous and was trying to make you the scape goat.\nLast month a priest came to us and said the parents of a 14 year old girl complained to him that you were molesting their daughter. We instructed the priest to have the parents go to you and complain, and if they could not obtain satisfaction then they should come to the Chancery.”\nSullivan’s typed notes then continued with a detailed description of Gina and her parents’ complaint of sexual abuse committed by Kownacki. The notes stated that Gina and her family came to the chancery on April 24, 1973, to inform the officers of the Diocese about Kownacki’s repeated molestation of and violence toward Gina, a minor.\nAccording to Sullivan’s notes, Gina, a 16-year-old girl, attended religious instruction classes taught by Kownacki in St. Francisville. In addition, Gina cleaned the rectory for Kownacki in St. Francisville. At the April 24, 1973, meeting, Gina described an occasion when Kownacki took her to his mother’s house in Tamaroa, Illinois, to clean. Sullivan’s notes of the meeting quoted Gina as follows: “ ‘Then that night we stayed in his Mother’s home, and I went to bed and the next thing I knew Father was in bed with me and we had intercourse.’ ” At the meeting, Gina also described another incident when Kownacki came into the bathroom as she cleaned, closed the door, and started kissing her.\nGina told the officers of the Diocese that Kownacki told her that he had money and could send her to school to study art. When Kownacki was assigned to the parish in Washington Park, Illinois, he convinced Gina’s parents to allow her to go to Washington Park with him. Kownacki told her parents that he would send Gina to school and would pay her $200 per month to be his housekeeper. Gina told the Diocese’s bishop and chancellor about incidents of physical and sexual abuse she endured at the hands of Kownacki after they moved to Washington Park. The abuse continued regularly for nearly two years. Kownacki gave her alcohol and assured her that the sexual abuse was a good thing because God wanted people to love each other. The last incident occurred in March of 1973. At Washington Park, Gina eventually started dating a classmate, Carlos, and Kownacki became jealous of that relationship. At one point, Kownacki slapped Gina, called her a whore and a slut, and told her she was wrong in sharing her body with Carlos.\nKownacki told Gina about his housekeeper in Guatemala with whom he had sexual relations, and he boasted about many other girls who came to him in Guatemala “just for the pleasure of sex.” Kownacki told Gina that his housekeeper in Guatemala became pregnant. He told Gina that he was not the father of the housekeeper’s child because he was sterile but that he came back to the United States to get away from her. At some point, Sullivan’s notes continue, Gina also became pregnant. Kownacki reported to Gina that his doctor had now told him that he was not sterile. Gina did not know if her child’s father was Kownacki or her boyfriend. Kownacki told Gina that if she did not want the baby, she could have an abortion. He gave Gina a drink on two different days for the purpose of aborting the baby. Kownacki also told Gina that if the drinks did not work, he could “squeeze it out.” Gina told the Diocese’s bishop and chancellor that Kownacki put his fingers inside her, against her will, and tried to abort the baby, which caused her pain and a cervical infection.\nAt the meeting, Gina also reported to the Diocese that a pair of twin boys from Guatemala lived with Kownacki while he was assigned to the parish in Washington Park. According to Sullivan’s notes, Gina reported that one of the twins engaged in “homosexuality” with Kownacki. Gina also reported the name of another 14-year-old girl at the St. Martin of Tours parish in Washington Park whom she believed Kownacki was also involved with. Sullivan’s notes identified the girl by name. His notes indicated that Kownacki told Gina that he went to confession every week or so and that the bishop knew what he was doing. At the conclusion of their meeting with Gina and her family, the bishop and the chancellor determined that they needed to speak with Kownacki.\nOn April 26, 1973, Kownacki wrote Gina a letter, in which he said, among other things, “[D]espite scandal, reputation to me as a priest, *** I will always see that you are through this little crisis.” He told her that he was really concerned and cared about her and always would. He hoped that she was feeling much better and that she was happy. He told her that she had been the best part of his life in Washington Park and in St. Francisville. The next day, April 27, 1973, the bishop and the chancellor met with Kownacki at the chancery to discuss Gina’s allegations. At the end of his typewritten notes, Sullivan made a note of their meeting with Kownacki and further wrote as follows: “We told him the whole story without the details. We said he needs help.”\nAfter his meeting at the chancery, Kownacki wrote a second letter to Gina. In a letter dated May 2, 1973, he wrote to Gina as follows: “Guess it’s time to say ‘adios’ to a great little girl who will always be remembered as the best girl I knew and hoping I’m cured of my problem[;] you’ll always be in my mind.” He wrote that it took “shock from all sides” to make him realize that he needed help. He wrote that he would suffer “like Cain” in the future when people point a finger at him and say that he is an alcoholic and “a real mental case.” He told Gina, “[The] parishioners know only that I’m going away for a rest because of a possible nervous breakdown (which is literally true, too!).” He wrote, “Blot out from your memory the past two years and if you cannot, then all I ask is. . . . forgive me!” He told Gina that she could get his address but that he presumed she still thought of him as “that monster” who ruined her future.\nAt some point, the Diocese obtained copies of Kownacki’s letters to Gina. The record does not indicate how or when the Diocese obtained copies of the letters, but the record discloses that it had copies of Kownacki’s letters as early as 1984. The Diocese’s copies of Kownacki’s letters to Gina were placed in his personnel file, but Sullivan’s handwritten and transcribed notes were not. Instead, the Diocese kept Sullivan’s notes in a separate location that was undisclosed in the record.\nPrior to the 1990s, the Diocese did not have any specific policies or rules with respect to handling allegations of child sexual abuse by priests. The Catholic Church’s code of canon law, however, set out certain standards and rules that the Diocese was required to follow. The code of canon law required the bishop, or someone he delegated, to investigate allegations of sexual abuse or misconduct that were brought against any priest within the Diocese, and if the investigation showed the probability that something had happened, then a judicial trial was to be held. The Diocese, however, did not conduct any trial with respect to Gina’s allegations of abuse.\nInstead, approximately 1½ months after Gina reported Kownacki to the Diocese, Bishop Zuroweste asked Kownacki to resign as the pastor of St. Martin of Tours. Kownacki subsequently resigned from the parish effective June 28, 1973. The Diocese did not investigate the allegations of sexual misconduct by Kownacki while he was in Guatemala or the allegations of sexual misconduct involving the twin boys from Guatemala or the 14-year-old girl at St. Martin of Tours whom Gina had identified by name. In addition, the Diocese never disclosed the allegations of sexual abuse to any authorities or to any of the parishioners of St. Martin of Tours in Washington Park or the parishioners in St. Francisville. No one from the Diocese reached out to Gina to offer her any assistance in dealing with Kownacki’s abuse. Less than four months after removing Kownacki from the parish in Washington Park, the Diocese appointed Kownacki to St. Theresa’s parish in Salem, Illinois.\nII.\nWisniewski’s Childhood Before and After Meeting Kownacki\nWisniewski was born in 1961 in Wisconsin, and he was the second youngest child in a family of five children. At the time of the trial, he was 47 years old. Both of Wisniewski’s parents, Mel and Marcy, were raised in devout Catholic families in Wisconsin. Mel and Marcy attended Catholic grade schools and high schools in Wisconsin, went to church every week, and raised their children in the same Catholic traditions and environment. They took their children to church every Sunday, and they raised Wisniewski and his siblings to respect the priests of the church, to believe that they spoke God’s word, and to be actively involved in church life. Mel testified that Catholic priests, monsignors, and bishops were put on a pedestal in his family. Mel raised his family to do whatever the agents of the church said and to never question them.\nMel and Marcy moved their family from Wisconsin to rural Salem, Illinois, in 1964, when Wisniewski was three years old. They moved to Salem so Mel could open a retail music store. The only Catholic church in Salem, Illinois, was St. Theresa’s Catholic Church. Before moving their family to Salem, Mel and Marcy visited the church to meet the priest who was serving the church at that time. They joined St. Theresa’s before moving their family to Salem, and they have been members of that church ever since.\nAfter moving to Salem, Wisniewski and his brother and sisters became active in Catholic church life at St. Theresa’s parish. They attended the Catholic grade school in Salem before it closed, they received religious instructions and training at the church, and the bishop of the Diocese confirmed them into the faith. They attended mass every Sunday and sometimes during the week. Wisniewski’s father served as a commentator during mass at times. Wisniewski testified that he grew up to love the church and its teachings and to believe in the church. From a very young age, he was taught to respect the priests, to believe what they said was true, and to obey them.\nWisniewski and his parents described Salem in the 1970s as a small, friendly community, where everyone knew one another. The parents in Salem looked out for one another’s children, and the children rode their bicycles around the town without any concern from the parents. As a boy, Wisniewski was quiet and obedient. He did what he was told to do and never got into trouble. In 1973, he turned 12 years old and enjoyed a healthy and happy childhood. The course of Wisniewski’s life, however, was forever altered on November 8, 1973, when the Diocese appointed Raymond F. Kownacki as the priest at St. Theresa’s in Salem.\nOn October 26, 1973, the bishop sent a letter to Kownacki informing him of his appointment as the pastor of St. Theresa’s parish in Salem, Illinois, effective November 8, 1973. Speaking on behalf of the Diocese, the bishop told Kownacki that they were confident that he would find the people of the parish “responsive to [Kownacki’s] pastoral zeal.” In addition, the bishop expressed appreciation to Kownacki for his “help in solving the problems in Guatemala.”\nThe Diocese prepared an official appointment of Kownacki as the parish priest that was addressed to Kownacki. The official appointment sent to Kownacki, or a similar document addressed to the parish, would have been read to the parishioners of St. Theresa’s parish. The bishop’s official appointment stated that he had confidence in Kownacki’s knowledge, piety, prudence, experience, and general character. The Diocese’s official appointment “commanded] all, whom it may concern, to recognize [Kownacki] as such Pastor and grant [him] all necessary assistance.” No one from the Diocese informed the parishioners of St. Theresa’s about Kownacki’s past violence, sexual abuse, or sexual misconduct. At the trial, the Diocese’s official corporate representative, Monsignor James Margason, testified that by appointing Kownacki as the parish priest, the Diocese held Kownacki out as being safe and suitable to minister to the parishioners and have unsupervised contact with the parishioners’ children. No one from the Diocese restricted or supervised Kownacki’s contact with the minor children of St. Theresa’s. Since Mel and Marcy had no reason to distrust Kownacki, they put their full faith and trust in him to minister to their children.\nShortly after he came to St. Theresa’s, Kownacki met Wisniewski and began giving him special attention. Wisniewski took over the duties of taking care of the grounds around the church and around the priest’s residence, the rectory. With Marcy’s encouragement, Wisniewski also became an altar boy shortly after Kownacki arrived. Wisniewski started spending more time around the church than with his friends, and Mel and Marcy thought that was good because Wisniewski was helping the church. Mel’s retail music business required him to work long hours; so he and Marcy were pleased that their trusted priest had developed a special interest in their youngest son. Neither Mel nor Marcy had any reservations about Wisniewski working for Kownacki, because he was a priest.\nAt the trial, Wisniewski testified that he initially considered Kownacki a friend and someone to look up to. Kownacki related well to the children of the parish and was fun to be around. Wisniewski was interested in photography, and Kownacki purchased cameras and set up a darkroom in the church basement. Kownacki encouraged Wisniewski to take pictures around the parish community and at parish activities to be included in a parish newsletter and bulletin that Kownacki had planned. Wisniewski became interested in and talked to Kownacki about the priesthood and the functions of a priest. With the Diocese’s endorsement, Kownacki had the complete trust and confidence of St. Theresa’s parishioners, including Wisniewski and his parents.\nA few months after getting to know Wisniewsk, Kownacki asked him and another boy to spend the night with him at the rectory. That night, Wisniewski and the other boy watched movies with Kownacki. Kownacki plied them with alcohol. Wisniewski testified that it was hard alcohol of some type and that he had never had alcohol prior to that evening. As the evening progressed, the other boy became sleepy, and he retired to a spare bedroom in the rectory. Unfortunately, Wisniewski stayed awake watching television with Kownacki. Kownacki moved over to Wisniewski and started rubbing the 12-year-old’s shoulders and kissing his neck. Kownacki’s hand moved down and rubbed Wisniewski’s genitalia. Wisniewski had not been previously exposed to any kind of sexual encounter or education, and he was taught to obey and trust priests. He was confused. Kownacki led Wisniewski into his bedroom, took off Wisniewski’s clothes, and took off his own clothes. Kownacki performed oral sex on Wisniewski while he masturbated himself. After the molestation, Kownacki fell asleep. Wisniewski got up, washed himself, and went back into the other room. Wisniewski did not say anything to his parents or anyone else the next day because he was afraid he would get in trouble.\nWisniewski testified that additional incidents of sexual abuse continued after that evening on a continual basis for several years. The next incident of abuse occurred shortly after the first one, and the sexual abuse became “very routine.” The abuse consisted of mainly oral sex that occurred in the rectory, in the school, in the church, and in the darkroom that Kownacki had built for Wisniewski. Kownacki eventually told the other boys who also worked around the church that they were no longer needed, so that he could be alone with Wisniewski. Kownacki took Wisniewski on trips to St. Louis, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Guatemala, and Rome. Wisniewski testified that Kownacki sexually molested him on some overnight trips.\nAt the trial, Wisniewski did not remember the exact number of times he was molested by Kownacki, but he remembered it being more than 50 times. At first the abuse occurred on a weekly basis, but as the years went by and as Wisniewski became an older adolescent, the abuse tapered off and eventually ended by the time he was a sophomore or junior in high school.\nA psychiatrist, Dr. Stephen Peterson, testified that Kownacki utilized two coercive tactics to keep Wisniewski silent about and submissive to the abuse: positive coercion and negative coercion. At first, Kownacki used positive coercion by giving Wisniewski special attention in order to set him up for easy manipulation. In addition, Kownacki’s positive coercive tactics included telling Wisniewski that the sexual molestation was okay, that the Church condoned that sort of thing, and that there were other priests in the Diocese who did the same thing. Kownacki also used positive coercion by telling Wisniewski that the abuse was his way of relieving his stress. He also told Wisniewski that it proved that he was growing up and that it was good for him. Wisniewski testified that since he was taught to obey and believe the priest, he trusted Kownacki. He believed that what he was doing was okay because of what Kownacki told him. Peterson testified that Kownacki overwhelmed Wisniewski and programmed him to accept the behavior as good.\nHowever, there were times during the abuse that Wisniewski felt guilty about what was happening to him, and Kownacki could sense Wisniewski’s reluctance at these times. Kownacki then utilized what Peterson described as negative coercive tactics. At times when Wisniewski resisted Kownacki’s molestation, Kownacki threatened to tell everyone that Wisniewski was gay, to ruin Wisniewski’s parents’ business, and to force his family to move out of town. Kownacki kept a box next to his bed that contained a handgun, and there were times when Kownacki made threats to use the gun if Wisniewski ever told anyone about what was happening between them. One time Kownacki threatened to kill Wisniewski’s parents, and another time he threatened to kill himself. Kownacki’s threats scared Wisniewski, and he took them seriously. In addition, Wisniewski did not want his friends or anyone else to know what was happening, and he was afraid of people finding out if he said anything. Wisniewski testified that many times Kownacki was drunk when he made the threats and that Kownacki was mean when he was drunk.\nWisniewski testified that he continued to work around the parish grounds and agreed to go on trips with Kownacki because Kownacki had befriended him and, at the same time, he was afraid of Kownacki’s threats. He did not know what Kownacki was capable of, and in addition, he was still trusting, believing, and putting his faith in the Catholic priest.\nMel and Marcy had completely trusted Kownacki with their son and had no reservations about Wisniewski being around him. They testified that, had the Diocese told them that Kownacki had sexually molested other children in the past, they would not have allowed Wisniewski or any of their other children to be around him. However, no one from the Diocese told them anything about Kownacki’s past. Instead, the bishop publicly gave Kownacki his full confidence, vouched for his suitability to serve as the parish priest, and held him out as suitable to minister to and have unsupervised contact with the parish children.\nWisniewski graduated from high school in 1980, moved to Champaign, Illinois, and enrolled in Parkland College. At that point, Wisniewski wanted to move on with his life, and he successfully mastered the ability to put Kownacki’s molestation out of his mind. Although he never totally forgot about the abuse, he became successful in blocking it out of his mind. He did not let the abuse impact his daily activities or his psychological health. Wisniewski felt comfort in believing that he was Kownacki’s only victim. Kownacki had told him that he was the only one, and Wisniewski believed what Kownacki said. In addition, Wisniewski had no reason to believe that the Diocese had any knowledge relevant to Kownacki’s dangerous propensities. For a few years after Wisniewski moved away from Salem, Kownacki continued to serve as the priest at St. Theresa’s. Kownacki performed the marriages of Wisniewski’s brother and two of his sisters. Kownacki visited Wisniewski on a few occasions in Champaign, and he agreed to visit with Kownacki because he was afraid of the ramifications of telling him no.\nIII.\nAdditional Acts of Child Sexual Abuse and the Diocese’s Silence and Concealment\nMeanwhile, Kownacki’s sexual molestation and misconduct continued within the Diocese after Wisniewski left Salem, and the officers of the Diocese were aware of his continuing misconduct and abuse. In 1982, someone within the Diocese prepared a confidential report that detailed new allegations of sexual molestation by Kownacki. The report was not signed, and the evidence presented at the trial did not establish who authored the report. The evidence did establish, however, that the report was prepared by someone within the Diocese. The Diocese did not keep the report in Kownacki’s personnel file but kept it in an undisclosed location in the chancery.\nThe 1982 report described information that the Diocese had received from the parents of a high school freshman boy at St. Theresa’s parish in Salem. The parents reported an incident involving Kownacki and their son. The freshman boy had been mowing Kownacki’s grass, and Kownacki called him on a Saturday and asked him to stay overnight. The freshman boy went jogging or had a track meet, and when he returned to the rectory, Kownacki told him to take a shower and that he would give him a massage. The report stated as follows: “This is when everything happened: fondling, kissing etc. [The boy] wanted to go home but [Kownacki] made him stay all night.”\nThe Diocese’s report also stated that Kownacki told the boy about two other parish boys whom he had also been involved with at one time. The report stated, “One is Jim Wisniewski (spelling?).” The boy did not remember the other victim’s name. According to the report, Kownacki told the freshman about the other boys because the boy was upset by what Kownacki was trying to do to him. Kownacki told him, “This is okay; I’ve done it before.” He told him that it was “a sign of friendship” and made him promise not to tell his parents.\nThe 1982 report stated that the mother of the freshman boy also reported to the Diocese that there was “an element of fear in her family” because she and her husband were concerned that Kownacki “might become vicious” after he found out she had reported him. They were keeping their doors locked and were careful where their children went. The unknown author of the 1982 confidential Diocese report concluded that Kownacki was “sick.” The Diocese representative who prepared the report assured the parents that something would be done. The report indicates that the parents responded that if something was not done, they would file a lawsuit because they did not want the same thing to happen to any other parish boys.\nIn 1982, Joseph Schwaegel served as the secretary to the bishop as well as the vice-chancellor of the Diocese. Schwaegel testified that, after the parents of the freshman boy complained to the Diocese that Kownacki had sexually molested their son, he had at least one conversation with the parents and asked them to keep quiet about what had happened. Schwaegel testified that the Diocese did not want to “go hanging the dirty laundry all over the line.” Therefore, he told the parents not to let “this get out all over the parish.” He told them, “Let’s just keep it quiet and try to get this resolved in whatever manner the Diocese will decide how to resolve this.”\nSchwaegel testified that, because of what the parents reported, he became aware that Wisniewski might have been a victim of sexual abuse committed by Kownacki. However, he did not make any attempt to contact Wisniewski or his parents. In addition, no one else from the Diocese contacted Wisniewski or his parents upon learning that Wisniewski had been molested by Kownacki. At the trial, Schwaegel was asked: “This boy [Wisniewski] was forgotten. He was written off as dirty laundry, wasn’t he?” Schwaegel answered, “Yes.”\nAlthough he was aware of the 1982 confidential memo at the time it was prepared, at the trial, Schwaegel denied ever seeing Sullivan’s 1973 notes that detailed Kownacki’s child sexual abuse of Gina. He testified that he was not working at the chancery when Sullivan created those notes and that there had been no need for Sullivan to share that information with him after he arrived at the chancery in late June of 1973.\nAfter the parents reported Kownacki’s abuse of their freshman son, the Diocese removed Kownacki as the parish priest at St. Theresa’s in Salem and immediately reassigned him as the pastor of St. Joseph’s parish in Cobden, Illinois, effective July 6, 1982. At this time, the bishop of the Diocese was John N. Wurm. On June 8, 1982, Bishop Wurm sent Kownacki a letter informing him that his new appointment was in view of his “dedicated priestly services” to the local church of Belleville. The bishop stated in his letter, “I heartily commend you to all the people of your parish.” When he was transferred to Cobden, Kownacki did not receive a pay cut, a demotion, a demerit, or any mark on his record.\nWhen the Diocese removed Kownacki as the parish priest at St. Theresa’s, it did not inform the parishioners that it had removed him because of allegations of sexual abuse. Although Bishop Wurm and other officers at the chancery were aware of the contents of the confidential 1982 report, the Diocese did not inform anyone at the parishes in Salem or in Cobden about the allegations brought by the mother of the freshman boy or about the allegation that Kownacki had molested Wisniewski and another boy at the parish. In addition, the Diocese did not tell any parishioners about prior allegations that Kownacki had committed sexual abuse and misconduct in Guatemala, with the twin boys he brought back from Guatemala, with Gina Parks, or with the 14-year-old girl at St. Martin of Tours. Instead, the Diocese held Kownacki out as an appropriate priest to minister to the parishioners in Cobden and to have unsupervised contact with the parishioners’ minor children. Schwaegel testified that when Kownacki was transferred to Cobden, everyone at the chancery knew that Kownacki was sick and liked to molest children. However, the Diocese did not provide any special supervision over Kownacki after he was transferred to Cobden.\nOn June 21, 1982, the local newspaper in Salem printed an article about Kownacki’s transfer to Cobden. The article reported that Kownacki was leaving St. Theresa’s parish because he had asked the bishop for an assignment in Cobden to “work with the Hispanic community in the Cobden area.” Kownacki was quoted in the article as follows: “ T find this assignment just another deep challenge of ministry ***. *** I have always loved the Spanish culture and even though I consider myself a “liberal-conservative,” I think I can be of help to the People of God of the Cobden area. Otherwise I would not have asked for a change in ministry.’ ”\nThe parents of the freshman boy at St. Theresa’s who had reported Kownacki to the Diocese were not happy with the contents of the newspaper article, and they wrote a letter addressed to Vice-Chancellor Schwaegel to express their displeasure. The parents stated in their letter that it had been a difficult time for their family and that they knew that the way that the bishop handled “the situation” was best for the parish and the “Catholic church as a whole.” However, the parents included a copy of the article with their letter and stated, “Here is a man, a priest who committed a very serious sin and instead of being sorry and leaving quietly, he pads it by lying.” The letter stated that the family had done as they were asked and had not “said anything to anybody.”\nSchwaegel responded to the parents in a letter dated June 25, 1982. Schwaegel told the family in his letter that he could understand their “difficulty in accepting the manner in which [Kownacki] describe[d] his termination at Salem and new assignment in Cobden.” Schwaegel continued, “Since you have been so kind in the manner in which you handled this situation, I am giving [Kownacki] the benefit of the doubt and praying that he truly desires to make a fresh start.” After telling the family that it was difficult to let “bygones be bygones,” he stated that he was sorry that Kownacki had to learn his lesson at the expense of their family.\nAt the trial, Schwaegel admitted that he gave Kownacki the benefit of the doubt without ever interviewing him. He testified that he relied on others inside the chancery for advice and that it was not his decision alone. In addition, he admitted that Kownacki had not learned any lesson as his letter falsely stated. Instead, the Diocese simply reassigned him to another parish, did not discipline him, and did not even give him a written warning.\nFor reasons undisclosed in the record, Kownacki was a priest in Cobden for less than a year before the Diocese transferred him to St. Mary’s parish in Harrisburg, Illinois. In a letter dated June 13, 1983, Bishop Wurm notified Kownacki that, in view of his “dedicated priestly service,” he had been appointed the pastor of St. Mary’s parish in Harrisburg and that he heartily commended him to all the people of that parish. Again, the Diocese did not inform the parishioners in Harrisburg about the previous allegations that Kownacki had sexually molested children and engaged in sexual misconduct.\nOn August 9, 1984, Schwaegel received a telephone call from another priest of the Diocese, Don Abell, who reported problems that the Harrisburg parish was having with Kownacki. Abell reported to Schwaegel that the trustees of the Harrisburg parish were irate over some recent incidents. Kownacki had two boys living in the rectory, and one of them had walked through a plate glass door. Abell told Schwaegel that a doctor had “fixed the kid up” and no one would “say how it happened.” Abell reported that Kownacki was paying the two boys $150 per week but that they did “absolutely nothing.” According to Abell, the janitor at the church also reported that many times when he arrived at the rectory in the morning, as many as five or six boys left the rectory, and the janitor presumed that they had been there all night. Abell told Schwaegel that Kownacki had “to be removed immediately or there [would] be nothing left of the Harrisburg parish.”\nBishop Wurm passed away in April of 1984, and the Diocese was between bishops at the time Abell made the telephone call to Schwaegel. Therefore, Schwaegel drafted a memo to Monsignor James Margason, passing on Abell’s information. Margason had been serving as the Diocese’s vicar general since October of 1983, and when Bishop Wurm passed away, he was appointed as the administrator of the Diocese until the appointment of a new bishop. In addition, in the 1970s, Margason had obtained a law degree in Rome on the Catholic Church’s code of canon law. Schwaegel’s memo to Margason concluded with, “good luck, Joe.” Schwaegel testified that in signing, “good luck,” he meant, “here we go again with Kownacki, so good luck with this one.”\nBecause Schwaegel’s memo stated that young boys were living in the rectory, one of Margason’s concerns was the possibility of improper sexual activity between Kownacki and the boys. Margason began his investigation by speaking with Chancellor Sullivan at the chancery and asking him if he had any information about allegations of sexual abuse or misconduct involving Kownacki that were not included in Kownacki’s personnel file. Sullivan then gave Margason copies of his notes from the meeting with Gina and her family that had occurred back on April 24, 1973. Margason testified that he had not seen Sullivan’s notes prior to investigating Kownacki in Harrisburg.\nMargason went to Harrisburg and met with the trustees of the Harrisburg parish. During the meeting, the trustees raised their concerns with Kownacki, including that young boys were living in the rectory, that the boys seemed to do nothing but were being paid, that Kownacki was drinking heavily, and that he had purchased a car in the parish’s name. The trustees were concerned because the parish was located in an area that was primarily non-Catholic, and they were concerned that their reputations were being damaged by Kownacki’s activities.\nMargason also talked to the church’s janitor, to Kownacki, and to the two boys who were living in the rectory with Kownacki. He testified that the boys could have been minors, but he was not sure. The two boys admitted that they had been staying at the rectory and had been drinking with Kownacki. They denied any sexual activity. One of the boys stated that he had an interest in becoming a priest. Kownacki and the boys denied that any other boys stayed at the rectory. At the trial, Margason testified that since Kownacki and the boys denied any sexual activity, he had to take their word. However, he did not try to contact the boys’ parents.\nMargason testified that having two boys living in the rectory was inappropriate and against the Diocesan statutes. Therefore, Margason told Kownacki and the boys that they all had to leave immediately. He offered Kownacki medical help; Kownacki accepted and returned to Belleville. Margason testified that Kownacki was removed from the Harrisburg parish because he was drinking, was misusing parish funds, and had people staying in the rectory who should not have been there.\nMargason stayed at the parish in Harrisburg that weekend and performed the parish services, a funeral, and a wake service. When Margason spoke with the Harrisburg parishioners, he told them that Kownacki had some problems and that he hoped the Diocese could get him the help he needed. Margason did not specifically tell the parishioners what kinds of problem Kownacki had or what kind of help he needed. He told the parishioners that it was time for a new beginning and that what had happened in the past was the past. Margason knew that there were stories circulating about Kownacki in the community. He told the parishioners that there was no point in saying “this is what I heard happened” or in repeating stories. Margason emphasized to the parishioners that if there was the slightest doubt in their minds that something they heard was true, then in justice they should not repeat it.\nOn September 10, 1984, Sullivan sent Kownacki a form for him to sign as his resignation as the pastor of St. Mary’s church in Harrisburg, effective August 17, 1984. The document stated that the resignation was due to an illness which prevented him from satisfactorily performing his pastoral duties. Kownacki was placed on sick leave and was assigned to the Hincke House as his residence and for treatment. At that time, he was not assigned to another parish.\nOn December 11, 1984, James E Keleher was ordained as the Diocese’s bishop, and Margason continued to serve as the vicar general under Bishop Keleher. In the late 1970s, the Diocese had established a personnel board that advised the bishop concerning appointments of priests to various parishes and offices in the Diocese. The personnel board members included the bishop, the vicar general, the chancellor, the vice-chancellor, and the secretary to the bishop. After the Diocese removed Kownacki from the Harrisburg parish and admitted him into the Hincke House for treatment, he became the subject of conversation at subsequent meetings of the personnel board. At the time, the personnel board included Bishop Keleher, Margason, Schwaegel, and Sullivan, among others. Schwaegel also served as the secretary of the personnel board, taking notes and preparing minutes.\nThe personnel review board met on February 26, 1985, and the minutes of that meeting stated that Margason was to visit Kownacki the following day. Nothing in the record reflects the Diocese doing anything further with respect to Kownacki until the April 2, 1985, personnel meeting. The minutes of that meeting stated, “In making assignments, must not forget about Fr. Kownacki.” The minutes of the May 9, 1985, meeting of the personnel board stated: “Fr. Kownacki is ready for a parish. Bishop informed him the Board is about ready to come up with a parish.”\nOn May 15, 1985, Bishop Keleher sent Kownacki a letter informing him that he was appointed the pastor of St. Eatrick’s parish in Tipton, Illinois, and the Immaculate Conception parish in Madonnaville, Illinois. The bishop’s letter stated that he was looking forward to Kownacki’s graduation from St. Michael’s on May 29, 1985, and that he was very pleased with the progress Kownacki made during his time at St. Michael’s. Testimony at the trial established that St. Michael’s is an alcohol treatment facility for priests.\nThe bishop told Kownacki in his letter: “[A]s you assume the pastoral responsibility of the parish communities at Tipton and Madonnaville, I am confident you will carry out your mission well in building up the Body of Christ at these two beautiful parishes. I will be also grateful for your strong support of Gibault High School.” The bishop concluded his letter with a profession of support for Kownacki in his new position. The letter stated that the appointment was after consultation with and approval by the personnel board. In a letter dated June 25, 1985, the bishop informed Kownacki that he was also appointed the pastor of St. Mary’s in Valmeyer, Illinois, after consultation with and approval of the personnel board. The bishop was confident that Kownacki would carry out his “mission well in building up the Body of Christ in these three beautiful parishes.”\nAgain, the Diocese did not inform Kownaeki’s new parishioners of the past allegations of sexual abuse or misconduct. By appointing Kownacki to these parishes, the Diocese again held him out as a safe and suitable priest to minister to the parishioners and have unsupervised contact with their children. This appointment included attending mass and performing services at Gibault Catholic High School.\nShortly after his new assignment, new allegations of impropriety arose involving Kownacki and young boys. In 1986, the rectory housekeeper at the Valmeyer parish met with Margason to talk about Kownacki and also sent Margason two letters about Kownacki. The housekeeper reported to Margason that there were young boys living in the rectory and that she had found a note in the rectory that was addressed to one of the boys. The note stated as follows: “Dear [redacted name of boy], come up to my bedroom if I am sleeping or not and massage me. I need it. I love you [redacted name of boy]. Ray.” The housekeeper also told Margason that she had also found a Playboy magazine in the rectory and found a “sexy picture out of a magazine under his bed.” She asked Margason to figure out what was “going on over there with those boys” and stated that “more and more people are going to Waterloo to mass because of [Kownacki] and what they hear.” The housekeeper stated that there was “something the matter” with Kownacki and that something had to be done before he wrecked the whole parish.\nMargason testified that the note that the housekeeper described was inappropriate for a priest to write to a young boy. Very soon after receiving this information, Margason went to Valmeyer to talk with the housekeeper, Kownacki, and the two young boys. Kownacki told Margason that there had not been any inappropriate activity with the boys but that he did not deny that the two young boys were spending time with him at the rectory. Margason did not know whether the boys were minors, and no one from the Diocese contacted their parents.\nIn March of 1987, Kownacki was no longer the priest in Tipton, but he was still the priest at Valmeyer and Madonnaville. The person nel board met on March 18, 1987, and the meeting was attended by, among others, Bishop Keleher, Abell, Margason, Sullivan, and Schwaegel. The minutes of this meeting state as follows: “This led to much discussion on Fr. Kownacki. Bishop said while we must take care of a brother priest, the diocese must also be considered. Much discussion.” On April 7, 1987, the personnel board met again, and the minutes stated that “nothing much ha[d] changed” with respect to Kownacki and that the board “agreed he should be moved from Valmeyer now.” (Emphasis in original.) The board discussed placement options and concluded that placing Kownacki in a hospital chaplaincy ministry could be dangerous. They determined that he should be moved to the Hincke House again, but one member of the board, Father Eichenseer, was concerned that Kownacki would have a lot of free time to go wherever he wanted and questioned how he would be supervised and who would do the supervising. Sullivan stressed that Kownacki must be active and not just sit around.\nThe record indicates that the Diocese subsequently removed Kownacki from his parishes and assigned him to Poor Clares, which is a cloistered convent for nuns and where there were no children. Margason testified that the Diocese removed Kownacki from his parishes because he was drinking again and having people living in the rectory who did not belong there. The Diocese again did not provide Kownacki’s parishioners with any information concerning the reasons for his reassignment.\nIn a letter dated June 22, 1988, Bishop Keleher informed Kownacki that he had been appointed to residence at St. Henry’s parish in Belleville, “after consultation and approval of the Priest Personnel Board.” Testimony at the trial established that St. Henry’s parish is next door to St. Henry’s Catholic Grade School and is near Althoff Catholic High School in Belleville. However, the Diocese did not provide the parishioners of St. Henry’s with any information concerning the past allegations of child sexual abuse and held Kownacki out as being a safe and suitable priest to minister to the parishioners and have unsupervised contact with their children.\nAs noted above, prior to the 1990s, the Catholic Church’s code of canon law required the bishop, or someone whom he delegated, to investigate allegations of sexual abuse of minors by priests, and if the investigation showed the probability that something had happened, then a judicial trial was to be held. The Diocese did not conduct any such trials during the ’60s, ’70s, or ’80s. In addition, Margason testified that, to his knowledge, during this period of time, the Diocese did not disclose to the public or to its parishioners any of the allegations it was aware of concerning their priests molesting or abusing minors.\nIn 1993, the Diocese adopted a “Policy Regarding Clerical Sexual Misconduct with Minors.” The policy began as follows: “Sexual misconduct by a priest with a minor violates human dignity, priestly commitment and the mission of the church.” Article 4 of the policy required all persons associated with the Diocese to comply with the letter and spirit of the policy, which required full and complete disclosure of allegations of clerical sexual abuse or misconduct with minors. The new policy established a review board charged with the duty of investigating allegations of sexual abuse or misconduct involving minors that were brought against parish priests. The review board investigated allegations that were either reported directly to members of the clergy or reported through a hotline the Diocese established for reporting such allegations. The review board investigated both current and past allegations of child sexual abuse.\nThe review board was composed of at least seven members appointed by the bishop. Four members were lay Catholics who were not employees of the Diocese, and three members were priests. Margie Mensen served as the administrator for the review board, and she held that position until 1998. She testified that her responsibility as the administrator for the review board was to investigate the allegations of child sexual abuse to determine whether the allegations were credible and to report her findings to the review board. She also reported directly to the bishop and Margason. Mensen’s duties included communicating with the victims of the child sexual abuse, offering them counseling, and communicating with the accused priests. Mensen did not have her own access to the priests’ personnel files, but she had the right to ask to see them.\nIn September of 1993, Bishop Keleher was transferred to Kansas City, and Margason was again elected as the administrator of the Diocese until the appointment of a new bishop. Margason had helped draft the 1993 policy that established the review board, but after the review board was installed, he remained silent about his knowledge of past allegations of sexual abuse of minors by Kownacki. Margason served as the Diocese’s administrator until Wilton D. Gregory was installed as the bishop in February of 1994.\nApproximately seven months after his arrival at the Diocese, Bishop Gregory issued a press release which stated that he was going to personally review all the priests’ personnel files to determine whether there was any information in the files that indicated prior undisclosed allegations of sexual abuse, molestation, or misconduct involving a priest and a minor. Bishop Gregory publicly announced that he wanted to ensure that there were no allegations of abuse that were undisclosed to the review board.\nDuring his review of the priests’ personnel files, Gregory reviewed Kownacki’s file and felt that it should be brought to the attention of the review board. Gregory asked Mensen to review Kownacki’s file, investigate, and take her findings before the review board. In October of 1994, Mensen reviewed Kownacki’s personnel file at the chancery. The personnel file that Mensen reviewed, however, did not contain Sullivan’s notes of the interview of Gina in 1973 and did not contain the 1982 confidential memo that named Wisniewski as a victim of Kownacki’s abuse.\nKownacki’s personnel file did include copies of the letters he wrote to Gina on April 26, 1973, and on May 2, 1973. Mensen found the letters to be troubling because they seemed “very inappropriate for someone in the priest’s position or someone of his adult age to be writing in such a personal manner to a young girl.” To Mensen, the letters suggested undue and troubling closeness. Based on the letters, Mensen felt that there was cause to conclude that perhaps Gina had been a victim of childhood sexual abuse committed by Kownacki.\nIn addition to Kownacki’s letters to Gina, Kownacki’s file also included the June 21, 1982, letter from the mother of the freshman boy in Salem, Illinois, who complained to Schwaegel when Kownacki misrepresented the reason for his reassignment from St. Theresa’s in Salem to the parish in Cobden. The file also included Schwaegel’s June 25, 1982, response letter to the freshman boy’s parents. These two letters caused Mensen to be concerned that there had been some sexual abuse or molestation by Kownacki at St. Theresa’s. Mensen had no means to contact the two victims she identified in the file materials, so she contacted the victims’ parents. Mensen subsequently interviewed Gina and her parents.\nBoth Gina and her parents told Mensen how Kownacki had befriended their family and had offered various forms of assistance. They told Mensen how Kownacki repeatedly and violently sexually molested Gina, that Gina became pregnant and thought Kownacki might have been the father, and that Kownacki drugged her and personally performed an abortion on her in the rectory which resulted in her unborn child dying in útero. Gina and her family described the emotional toll and pain Kownacki had caused, and Gina expressed concern about other children Kownacki might have had contact with. Gina told Mensen that no one from the Diocese offered her any help or assistance. Mensen testified that she found Gina very credible and that her symptoms were “very consistent with victims of sexual abuse.”\nAfter following up with the family in Salem, Illinois, Mensen concluded that Kownacki should be removed from active ministry. She reported her conclusions to the review board, and the review board agreed that Kownacki was a risk to abuse or molest other children. The review board asked few questions, and its vote was unanimous. The Diocese removed Kownacki from active ministry on January 13, 1995. It placed him on administrative leave. Kownacki was not defrocked or punished. He collected retirement benefits from the Diocese, and at the time of the trial, he had suffered a stroke but was living by himself in an apartment in Dupo, Illinois.\nMargason admitted at the trial that Kownacki was finally removed from active ministry 21 years after the Diocese first knew that Kownacki was a violent sexual child molester and 10 years after Margason himself became aware that Kownacki was a violent sexual child molester. The review board removed Kownacki based, in large part, on information that the Diocese had been aware of since the 1970s. Margason testified that had there been an independent review board in place in 1973, there was a good likelihood that Kownacki would have been removed then and would not have met Wisniewski.\nBishop Gregory held a press conference concerning Kownacki shortly after his removal, and an article about his removal appeared in the Diocese’s newsletter, The Messenger, on January 20, 1995. The article stated that Kownacki was placed on administrative leave for allegations of sexual abuse that occurred more than 10 years prior.\nAlthough Kownacki was removed from active ministry, the Diocese never disclosed to Mensen or the review board the existence of Sullivan’s 1973 notes. As noted above, Sullivan’s 1973 notes referenced other incidents of sexual abuse and molestation in addition to the incidents involving Gina. Sullivan’s 1973 notes mentioned by name the twin boys from Guatemala who lived with Kownacki in Washington Park and another 14-year-old girl who was a parishioner in Washington Park as potential victims of Kownacki’s sexual molestation. The notes also identified by name the housekeeper in Guatemala whom Kownacki might have impregnated. Mensen testified that had she seen Sullivan’s notes, she would have investigated these additional incidents and would have attempted to reach these potential victims.\nFurthermore, the Diocese never disclosed to Mensen or the review board the 1982 confidential report that described the allegations from the family in Salem concerning their freshman son. As noted above, the 1982 report stated that Kownacki had claimed to have molested two other boys at the Salem parish, and Wisniewski was named as one of those boys. Therefore, when they investigated Kownacki, neither Mensen nor the review board was informed or was aware that Wisniewski was a victim of Kownacki’s abuse. Mensen testified that, had the 1982 report been a part of Kownacki’s file, she would have known that Wisniewski was a potential victim. She would have investigated the allegation and would have talked with Wisniewski to determine whether the abuse likely occurred.\nSection 1.5 of the Diocese’s 1993 policy regarding clerical sexual misconduct with minors provided as follows: “In the case of any disclosure of sexual misconduct with a minor, the Vicar General shall report the fact to the review administrator.” Mensen testified that the policy included all sexual misconduct regardless of whether it occurred before or after the Diocese adopted the policy. She further testified that the Diocese violated its policy when it did not disclose the information in its possession that detailed additional, undisclosed allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct perpetrated by Kownacki, including his molestation of Wisniewski. Gregory testified that the missing documents should have been kept in Kownacki’s personnel file, but they were not.\nAt the trial, Margasen denied seeing the 1982 confidential memo until after Wisniewski filed his lawsuit against the Diocese, but he admitted that he was aware of some of Kownacki’s other deviant sexual practices back in 1984, including the information contained in Sullivan’s 1973 notes. He admitted that he never reported that information to the review board at any time even though he had a duty under the Diocese’s 1993 policy to do so. He admitted that he breached the policy and withheld information from the review board, a policy that he helped draft.\nrv\nWisniewski’s Injuries\nMeanwhile, after Wisniewski moved away from Salem, he completed college and went to work in the healthcare industry at a hospital in Champaign, Illinois. He met and fell in love with his wife, Carol. They were married in 1984 and had two children together. Their daughter, Ashley, was born in October of 1987, and at the time of the trial, she was in her junior year at the University of Illinois. Their son, Andrew, was born in April of 1989, and he suffered from autism. Wisniewski testified that although his son was fairly high functioning, his son’s autism prevented him from living on his own. Wisniewski suspected that their son would have to live with them the remainder of his life.\nWisniewski was successful at his chosen career and was promoted to be the director of his department at the hospital. Wisniewski testified that until 2002, he was happy and was leading a healthy and productive life. He and Carol had problems from time to time, and they faced the challenges of raising an autistic child, but they worked through and dealt with their problems. He enjoyed his family and being around people. At work, he effectively interacted with upper management and corporate executives. He was successful at repressing his memories of Kownacki’s sexual abuse. Carol testified that Wisniewski had been a great father and had been actively involved in their children’s lives. Wisniewski was a hard worker, he made Carol laugh, and she made him laugh.\nIn 2002, however, Wisniewski’s life changed. Carol and Wisniewski testified that, in early 2002, the national news carried stories about priests in Boston, Massachusetts, who had molested children. The reports were prominent in the national news. Wisniewski became overwhelmed with the scandal and could not get it out of his mind. He was particularly troubled by reports that the Boston priests had abused many victims. Thoughts of his own abuse continually came up in his mind. In the past he had successfully put those thoughts aside, but now he could not suppress the memories. Based on the news reports concerning the Boston priests, Wisniewski began to wonder if Kownacki had abused other victims either before or after his abuse. He became anxious, uptight, irritable, and overwhelmed with a feeling of guilt that there could have been more victims after he had been abused. Wisniewski started having trouble sleeping and began having nightmares. His memories and thoughts of Kownacki’s abuse preoccupied his thinking.\nWisniewski had never told anyone what Kownacki had done to him. When the Boston priest scandal became national news, Carol read a lot of news articles about it, and one evening, she asked Wisniewski, “Father Ray never did anything to you, did he?” Wisniewski intended to go to his grave never saying anything to anyone about Kownacki’s molestation, but Carol’s question caught him off guard. He told her that he had been abused by Kownacki, beginning when he was 12 years old and continuing until he was about 17.\nCarol testified that she felt devastated and asked Wisniewski why he had never said anything. Wisniewski told her about Kownacki’s threats and told her that he had blocked it out of his mind. Carol testified, “It was like it was just buried in there and he built up a wall around himself.” They spent most of that night crying, talking, and trying to make sense out of it.\nCarol also testified that she noticed changes in Wisniewski’s personality. Wisniewski became withdrawn and irritable and no longer smiled, and his condition got worse over time. Carol testified that Wisniewski’s condition was “awful” and “unbearable.” He was short-tempered with her and their children, had lost confidence in himself, and started suffering from panic attacks and nightmares. He was no longer the person she had fallen in love with and married. The revelation of Kownacki’s abuse had affected her, their marriage, their family, and their faith.\nIn May of 2002, Wisniewski sought help from a psychiatrist, David Kopacz. Kopacz testified that Wisniewski came to see him because he had been very upset “about the media coverage of sexual abuse in the Catholic church because he was abused by a priest when he was a boy.” Kopacz described Wisniewski’s symptoms as feeling overwhelmed, reliving specific episodes of abuse, having nightmares, waking up screaming, and not being able to forget what had happened in the past. Wisniewski tried to avoid the news because it was upsetting him more and more. Wisniewski told Kopacz that he had lost his faith in God and in the Church. According to Kopacz, there was no indication in Wisniewski’s history after he went to college of any significant problems in functioning or coping in his life until the media coverage in early 2002.\nKopacz testified that Wisniewski came from a devout Catholic family that respected and integrated their church’s priest into the family’s life. Kopacz explained that, as a child, Wisniewski was very submissive and was programmed to believe everything Kownacki said. According to Kopacz, Kownacki used threats, coercion, and manipulation to alter Wisniewski’s sense of reality. Kopacz initially made a temporary diagnosis that Wisniewski suffered from an adjustment disorder and anxiety, but he later concluded that he suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder that was a direct result of the childhood sexual abuse perpetrated by Kownacki. The posttraumatic stress disorder first manifested itself in 2002, one or two months before his diagnosis. Kopacz rated Wisniewski’s symptoms on the border between moderate and severe. Kopacz prescribed Wisniewski medications to help him sleep and to help with his anxiety.\nOn May 24, 2002, Wisniewski discussed with Kopacz whether he should inform his parents of the abuse, stating that he hoped to feel better after telling his parents. In addition, Wisniewski told Kopacz that he had been looking into some background information on how much the Diocese had known about Kownacki before he was transferred to Salem. On July 4, 2002, Wisniewski told his parents that Kownacki had molested him when he was a boy. His parents had no idea that Kownacki had abused him. They asked him why he had never said anything, and he told them of Kownacki’s threats. In addition, he said he was embarrassed and just could not tell them.\nAfter July 4, 2002, Marcy noticed Wisniewski losing weight. In addition, she testified that Wisniewski had always been a quiet person but that he spoke even less after July 4, 2002. After Wisniewski’s disclosure to his parents, he rarely talked with his wife about the abuse. He refused to discuss it. Carol testified that Wisniewski was getting less than two hours of sleep each night, and she was worried that their family was not going to make it. On July 31, 2002, Wisniewski lost his job at the hospital for reasons unrelated to his lawsuit against the Diocese, and he and Carol subsequently opened a custom picture-framing business in Champaign.\nWisniewski continued to wonder what the Diocese knew about Kownacki before it transferred him to Salem, and he decided to take steps to find out. He did not believe that the Diocese would freely give him that information. He contacted an attorney, and on October 24, 2002, he filed his lawsuit against the Diocese. He testified that he filed the lawsuit to get the answers he wanted, and he hoped that some answers would help relieve his symptoms and guilt. Kopacz last saw Wisniewski on December 13, 2002. At that time, he still suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder.\nPrior to filing the lawsuit, neither Wisniewski nor his parents knew that Kownacki had been removed from active ministry by the review board. Kownacki continued to send Wisniewski and his parents Christmas cards until Christmas of 2001. He signed the Christmas cards “Fr. Ray.” They sent him cards in return, including birthday cards. No one from the Diocese ever contacted them to tell them that Kownacki had been removed and that they had information that Kownacki might have abused Wisniewski.\nDr. Peterson, a psychiatrist, evaluated Wisniewski for the purpose of giving an opinion at the trial about whether Wisniewski had experienced any psychological injury as a consequence of Kownacki’s sexual molestation and, if so, when Wisniewski understood he was injured and whether he needed treatment. Peterson testified that children who have experienced prolonged sexual abuse often suffer psychological difficulty, such as major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance abuse problems, and problems with their sexual functioning. They also frequently have many internal difficulties that they have a hard time expressing, and their issues stem from trying to make sense out of situations that should have never happened.\nPeterson performed a comprehensive psychiatric assessment of Wisniewski that included obtaining his history. The facts that Wisniewski came from a devout Catholic family and that the molester was a priest were significant to Peterson. He testified that serial sexual abusers often get to know a family or they find children who are vulnerable in some way. When Wisniewski was growing up, his father was on the road often for business. In addition, the priest stood in the role of a special envoy between God and the family and was acting in a very important role in the spiritual life of Wisniewski’s family. Wisniewski’s parents trusted the priest and were disarmed by his position in the church. Peterson testified that this situation set up a power imbalance between Kownacki and Wisniewski which enabled Kownacki to very easily manipulate Wisniewski.\nPeterson testified that Wisniewski did not initially appreciate or know that he was harmed because the priest overwhelmed him and because Wisniewski came to believe that he was actually acting in a positive way to help the priest. In Peterson’s opinion, Wisniewski did not report the conduct to his parents because of Kownacki’s position as the envoy between God and Wisniewski’s family; he wielded incredible emotional and spiritual power. Wisniewski was 12 or 13 years old, which, psychologically, was a latency period when he was learning about morals and about what was right and wrong. Peterson explained that the priest, who was a hero to Wisniewski, told Wisniewski to do things that he was uncomfortable with but that the priest reassured him that it was not wrong.\nIn addition to interviewing Wisniewski, Peterson also gave Wisniewski a series of psychological tests. Peterson concluded that Wisniewski had experienced significant psychological trauma as a result of the sexual abuse he endured. Wisniewski suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic type of delayed onset, and he was experiencing a major depressive disorder with prominent anxiety.\nPeterson believed that Wisniewski’s posttraumatic stress disorder manifested itself when the media publicized the Boston priest scandal in January of 2002 and when his wife asked him directly about his experience. Prior to that time, “he never really thought about it.” Peterson did not find any evidence that Wisniewski exhibited any criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder prior to January of 2002.\nPeterson concluded that the repeated episodes of child molestation that started when Wisniewski was 12 caused him to develop posttraumatic stress disorder that did not manifest itself until 2002. According to Peterson, Wisniewski’s mind had utilized defense mechanisms to minimize the effects of the abuse. Wisniewski came to believe that his abuser was right and that Wisniewski helped Kownacki. He accepted that Kownacki’s affection toward him was a good thing, and while he never fully forgot the sexual acts themselves, his main defense mechanism was believing that what he did was helpful to the priest.\nPeterson explained that a lot of children and adults will keep such things inside until something pierces their defense mechanisms and overwhelms their psychological need to look away. In Wisniewski’s case, Peterson testified, one of the things that seemed to comfort Wisniewski was that he believed that he was the only one who had been abused by Kownacki. In January of 2002, however, when sexual abuse by priests was national news, Wisniewski was faced with the possibility that potentially many others had been sexually abused. Peterson explained that the news stories overwhelmed Wisniewski’s defenses and that when his wife directly asked him if he had been abused, he realized that what he had done was not to help the priest but that he had been manipulated and had been “misused.” At that point, Wisniewski started experiencing the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, including nightmares about what had happened, depression, loss of energy and focus, difficulty sleeping, persistent suicidal thoughts, and recollections about his abuse that intruded on his relationship with his wife.\nPeterson testified that in his opinion, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, when all of these events occurred in 2002, Wisniewski first became aware that he had sustained an injury as a result of the repeated acts of sexual molestation he suffered as a child. According to Peterson, Wisniewski needed two basic types of treatment. First, he needed medications to help relieve his depression and his anxiety disorder, including a combination of antidepressants, anti-anxiety agents, and perhaps some antiobsessional agents. He would need to be on such medications for 5 to 10 years at a minimum. Second, Wisniewski needed psychotherapy focused on the things that were most troubling to him and to his family as a consequence of realizing he was harmed. The psychotherapy Wisniewski needed would be “quite lengthy.”\nV\nTrial Court Proceedings and Jury Trial\nWisniewski filed his complaint against the Diocese on October 24, 2002, alleging several theories of liability. In addition, he alleged that the Diocese fraudulently concealed his cause of action against it and that, therefore, the Diocese should be barred from asserting as a defense the statute of limitations or the statute of repose. The Diocese subsequently filed a motion for a summary judgment that raised the statute of limitations and the statute of repose. The circuit court denied the Diocese’s motion for a summary judgment. The circuit court held that Wisniewski’s complaint was untimely under the relevant statutes of limitations and repose. However, the circuit court denied the Diocese’s motion for a summary judgment because it found that Wisniewski had raised a question of fact to be determined by the jury concerning whether the Diocese fraudulently concealed his cause of action. Wisniewski had also raised a question of fact concerning whether the Diocese should be barred from asserting the statutes of limitations and repose based on the doctrines of equitable estoppel or equitable tolling.\nAt the juxy trial, the circuit court instructed the jury that it would first have to determine whether the Diocese fraudulently concealed Wisniewski’s cause of action. The jury was instructed that it could only address the issues of liability and damages if it found in Wisniewski’s favor on the issue of fraudulent concealment. While the jury deliberated, the circuit court entered a separate order, ruling that Wisniewski’s claims against the Diocese were not barred by the statute of limitations or the statute of repose. The circuit court found that Wisniewski had established equitable estoppel and equitable tolling by clear and convincing evidence. The jury then returned a verdict finding that the Diocese fraudulently concealed Wisniewski’s cause of action against it and finding that the Diocese was liable for Wisniewski’s injuries. The jury awarded Wisniewski $2.4 million in compensatory damages and $2.6 million for punitive damages. The Diocese filed a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (n.o.v.) that raised, among other issues, the statute of limitations and the statute of repose. The circuit court denied the Diocese’s motion for a judgment n.o.v. The Diocese appeals.\nANALYSIS\nThe Diocese raises the following arguments on appeal: (I) that, as a matter of law, Wisniewski’s claims are time-barred by the relevant statute of repose and statute of limitations, (II) that Wisniewski’s claims were legally insufficient, (III) that the circuit court abused its discretion in denying its request to perform a mental examination of Wisniewski pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 215 (eff. July 1, 2002), and (IV) that the circuit court abused its discretion in making certain evidentiary rulings. We will discuss each argument in turn.\nI.\nStatute of Repose and Statute of Limitations\nThe first arguments that the Diocese raises on appeal are that Wisniewski’s claims against it are time-barred as a matter of law by the relevant statute of repose and statute of limitations. The Diocese also argues that, as a matter of law, neither the fraudulent concealment statute nor the common law discovery rule tolled the running of the statute of repose or the statute of limitations. The Diocese concludes that the circuit court, therefore, should have granted its motion for a judgment n.o.v. at the conclusion of the trial because Wisniewski’s claims were untimely.\nAt the outset, we note that the Diocese does not contend on appeal that the jury was improperly instructed on any of the issues it decided; therefore, we will assume that the jury was properly instructed. See Ford v. Baker, 61 Ill. App. 3d 45, 46, 377 N.E.2d 853, 854 (1978). When the jury has been properly instructed, we are reluctant to set aside the jury’s verdict, because many factors, including the credibility of the witnesses, are considered by the jury in reaching its verdict. See Ford, 61 Ill. App. 3d at 46, 377 N.E.2d at 854 (“When the jury has been properly instructed, both trial and reviewing courts are reluctant to set aside the amount of the jury verdict.”).\nA statute of repose and a statute of limitations are separate and distinct statutes that place a limitation on the time in which a plaintiff has to file his or her lawsuit. The difference between a statute of limitations and a statute of repose is that “a statute of limitations governs the time within which lawsuits may be commenced after a cause of action has accrued, while a statute of repose extinguishes the action itself after a fixed period of time, regardless of when the action accrued.” DeLuna v. Burciaga, 223 Ill. 2d 49, 61, 857 N.E.2d 229, 237 (2006).\nIn general, the statute of limitations begins to run on the date the plaintiffs cause of action accrues, and in personal injury actions, that usually occurs on the date of the injury. Golla v. General Motors Corp., 167 Ill. 2d 353, 360, 657 N.E.2d 894, 898 (1995). However, the application of this general rule could be unduly harsh if it barred a plaintiff from bringing suit before the plaintiff was even aware that he was injured. Golla, 167 Ill. 2d at 360, 657 N.E.2d at 898. “To alleviate the harsh consequences that would flow from literal application of the limitations period, the judiciary created the ‘discovery rule,’ ” which “postponed] the commencement of the relevant statute of limitations until the injured plaintiff knows or reasonably should know that he has been injured and that his injury was wrongfully caused.” Golla, 167 Ill. 2d at 360-61, 657 N.E.2d at 898.\nA statute of repose, however, is designed to place an outer limit on the “long tail” of liability created by the common law discovery rule. Hester v. Diaz, 346 Ill. App. 3d 550, 553, 805 N.E.2d 255, 259 (2004). Accordingly, a statute of repose “is intended to terminate the possibility of liability after a defined period of time, regardless of a potential plaintiffs lack of knowledge of his or her cause of action.” Ferguson v. McKenzie, 202 Ill. 2d 304, 311, 780 N.E.2d 660, 664 (2001). Statutes of repose do not incorporate the discovery rule and generally terminate claims regardless of a plaintiffs lack of knowledge of his or her cause of action. Goodman v. Harbor Market, Ltd., 278 Ill. App. 3d 684, 690-91, 663 N.E.2d 13, 18 (1995).\nAlthough a statute of repose does not normally incorporate the discovery rule, a statute of repose, nonetheless, can be tolled if a plaintiff does not discover his claim due to fraudulent concealment on the part of the defendant. In DeLuna, the Illinois Supreme Court held that fraudulent concealment can toll the running of a statute of repose because “there would be an obvious and gross injustice in a rule that allows a defendant — particularly a defendant who stands in a fiduciary relationship to the plaintiff — to conceal the plaintiffs cause of action and then benefit from a statute of repose.” DeLuna, 223 Ill. 2d at 71, 857 N.E.2d at 242.\nIn the present case, Wisniewski was abused in the 1970s and maintained that he did not discover his claim until 2002. In order to toll the running of the statute of limitations under the common law discovery rule, Wisniewski was required to prove that he neither knew nor reasonably should have known that he had been injured and that his injury was wrongfully caused until 2002. To toll the running of the statute of repose, however, under the fraudulent concealment statute, Wisniewski had to prove not only that he did not discover his claim until 2002 but also that his failure to discover his claim was due to fraudulent concealment committed by the Diocese.\nWe begin our analysis of the circuit court’s denial of the Diocese’s motion for a judgment n.o.v. with a discussion of the applicable statute of repose and the jury’s finding of fraudulent concealment. We will then discuss the statute of limitations and application of the common law discovery rule to the facts of the case. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the circuit court properly denied the Diocese’s motion for a judgment n.o.v. on the issues concerning the timeliness of Wisniewski’s claim. We find that, under the facts of this case, the application of the fraudulent concealment statute and the common law discovery rule presented factual issues for the jury to consider, not legal issues that the circuit court was required to find in the Diocese’s favor as a matter of law.\nA.\nStatute of Repose\nPrior to January 1, 1991, Illinois did not have a statute of repose applicable to personal injury claims arising from childhood sexual abuse. On January 1, 1991, the Illinois General Assembly added section 13 — 202.2 to the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure (the Code) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 110, par. 13 — 202.2), which established a statute of repose applicable to childhood sexual abuse cases. When enacted in 1991, section 13 — 202.2(b) read as follows:\n“(b) An action for damages for personal injury based on childhood sexual abuse must be commenced within 2 years of the date the person abused discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should discover that the act of childhood sexual abuse occurred and that the injury was caused by the childhood sexual abuse, but in no event may an action for personal injury based on childhood sexual abuse be commenced more than 12 years after the date on which the person abused attains the age of 18 years.” Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 110, par. 13 — 202.2(b).\nAccordingly, section 13 — 202.2(b), as enacted in 1991, contained a 2-year statute of limitations and a 12-year statute of repose.\nThe effect of the enactment of the 1991 statute of repose contained in section 13 — 202.2 was “to bar anyone over the age of 30 from bringing an action for personal injury based on childhood sexual abuse.” Doe A. v. Diocese of Dallas, 234 Ill. 2d 393, 408, 917 N.E.2d 475, 484 (2009). In the present case, Wisniewski turned 30 on March 6, 1991, approximately two months after the legislature enacted the statute of repose.\nEffective January 1, 1994, the legislature eliminated the 12-year statute of repose for childhood sexual abuse claims. After the 1994 amendment, section 13 — 202.2(b) provided as follows:\n“(b) An action for damages for personal injury based on childhood sexual abuse must be commenced within 2 years of the date the person abused discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should discover that the act of childhood sexual abuse occurred and that the injury was caused by the childhood sexual abuse.” 735 ILCS 5/13 — 202.2(b) (West 1994).\nHowever, the legislature’s repeal of the statute of repose is not applied retroactively to revive claims that had expired prior to the repeal of the statute of repose. The Illinois Supreme Court has held that the Illinois Constitution does not permit retroactive application of amendments to section 13 — 202.2(b) to revive otherwise time-barred claims for childhood sexual abuse. Diocese of Dallas, 234 Ill. 2d at 409, 917 N.E.2d at 484. The court stated, “ ‘[I]f the claims were time-barred under the old law, they remained time-barred even after the repose period was abolished by the legislature.’ ” Diocese of Dallas, 234 Ill. 2d at 409, 917 N.E.2d at 484 (quoting M.E.H. v. L.H., 177 Ill. 2d 207, 215, 685 N.E.2d 335, 339 (1997)). Accordingly, for purposes of analyzing the timeliness of Wisniewski’s claim with respect to the statute of repose, we must apply the 1991 version of section 13 — 202.2 of the Code to his claim.\nUnder the 1991 statute of repose, Wisniewski had until he turned 30 to file his action against the Diocese, but he did not file his claim until 2002, when he was 41 years old. In response to the statute of repose, Wisniewski invoked the fraudulent concealment statute and maintained that he did not discover that he was injured and did not discover the Diocese’s wrongful conduct until 2002 because of the Diocese’s fraudulent concealment. The issue of fraudulent concealment was submitted to the jury, and the jury decided the issue in Wisniewski’s favor.\n1.\nThe Jury’s Finding of Fraudulent Concealment\nAs we stated, prior to the trial, the Diocese filed a motion for a summary judgment that raised the statute of repose. The circuit court, however, denied the Diocese’s motion, finding that there were material issues of fact concerning the application of the fraudulent concealment statute to toll the running of the statute of repose. The circuit court determined that it would submit the issue of fraudulent concealment to the jury to be decided before the jury considered issues of liability and damages.\nAt the trial, the jury resolved the issue of fraudulent concealment in Wisniewski’s favor by entering a verdict deciding that issue in his favor. The jury also entered a general verdict in Wisniewski’s favor awarding damages. At the conclusion of the trial, the Diocese filed a motion for a judgment n.o.v., arguing, among other things, that the evidence did not establish fraudulent concealment as a matter of law. The circuit court denied the Diocese’s motion for a judgment n.o.v., and on appeal, the Diocese argues that the circuit court erred in denying the motion. Therefore, the fraudulent concealment issue is presented to us on appeal by way of the circuit court’s denial of a motion for a judgment n.o.v.\nA trial court’s ruling on a motion for a judgment n.o.v. is subject to a de novo standard of review. McClure v. Owens Corning Fiberglas Corp., 188 Ill. 2d 102, 132, 720 N.E.2d 242, 257 (1999). A judgment n.o.v. is properly entered only in those limited cases where “all of the evidence, when viewed in its aspect most favorable to the opponent, so overwhelmingly favors movant that no contrary verdict based on that evidence could ever stand.” Pedrick v. Peoria &amp; Eastern R.R. Co., 37 Ill. 2d 494, 510, 229 N.E.2d 504, 513-14 (1967). “In ruling on a motion for a judgment n.o.v., a court does not weigh the evidence, nor is it concerned with the credibility of the witnesses; rather it may only consider the evidence, and any inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the party resisting the motion.” Maple v. Gustafson, 151 Ill. 2d 445, 453, 603 N.E.2d 508, 512 (1992). “Most importantly, a judgment n.o.v. may not be granted merely because a verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence.” Maple, 151 Ill. 2d at 453, 603 N.E.2d at 512. Therefore, in the present case, we are asked to determine, among other issues, whether the evidence justified the submission of the fraudulent concealment issue to the jury. See Valdes v. Karoll’s, Inc., 277 F.2d 637, 638 (7th Cir. 1960). Applying this standard, we cannot say that the evidence supports only one reasonable conclusion in the Diocese’s favor on the issue of fraudulent concealment. Rather, we find that there was ample evidence to support the jury’s verdict on that issue.\nThe doctrine of fraudulent concealment is codified in section 13 — 215 of the Code, and it provides, “If a person liable to an action fraudulently conceals the cause of such action from the knowledge of the person entitled thereto, the action may be commenced at any time within 5 years after the person entitled to bring the same discovers that he or she has such cause of action, and not afterwards.” 735 ILCS 5/13 — 215 (West 2008). “Fraudulent concealment, as codified in section 13 — 215, is not a cause of action in and of itself; rather, it acts as an exception to the time limitations imposed on other, underlying causes of action.” Cangemi v. Advocate South Suburban Hospital, 364 Ill. App. 3d 446, 459, 845 N.E.2d 792, 805 (2006).\n“The concealment contemplated in section 13 — 215 must consist of affirmative acts or representations which are calculated to lull or induce a claimant into delaying filing of his claim or to prevent a claimant from discovering his claim.” Smith v. Cook County Hospital, 164 Ill. App. 3d 857, 862, 518 N.E.2d 336, 340 (1987). “A plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant made misrepresentations or performed acts which were known to be false, with the intent to deceive the plaintiff, and upon which the plaintiff detrimentally relied.” Orlak v. Loyola University Health System, 228 Ill. 2d 1, 18, 885 N.E.2d 999, 1009 (2007).\nAs a general rule, mere silence on the part of the defendant and a failure by the plaintiff to learn of the cause of action are not enough to establish fraudulent concealment. Chicago Park District v. Kenroy, Inc., 78 Ill. 2d 555, 561, 402 N.E.2d 181, 185 (1980). However, there is an exception to this general rule when there is a fiduciary or trust or other confidential relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 562, 402 N.E.2d at 185. The prevailing rule is that when such a relationship exists, the person occupying the position of fiduciary or of confidence is under a duty to reveal the facts to the plaintiff, and his silence is as fraudulent as an actual affirmative false representation or act. Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 562, 402 N.E.2d at 185. Silence by a person in a position of trust concerning the facts giving rise to a cause of action amounts to fraudulent concealment. Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 562, 402 N.E.2d at 185.\nOn appeal, the Diocese argues that the evidence was insufficient to submit the issue of fraudulent concealment to the jury because there was no evidence presented at the trial that the Diocese made any misrepresentations directly to Wisniewski that lulled him into delaying the filing of his claim or prevented him from discovering he had a claim against the Diocese. In addition, the Diocese maintains that it was not in a fiduciary, special, or confidential relationship with Wisniewski and that, therefore, its silence with respect to Wisniewski’s claim does not support a finding that it fraudulently concealed the claim. We disagree. When viewing the evidence presented at the trial in the light most favorable to Wisniewski, we cannot conclude that the evidence so overwhelmingly favors the Diocese on the issue of fraudulent concealment that the jury’s verdict cannot stand.\nAt the trial, the circuit court instructed the jury to first decide whether the Diocese fraudulently concealed the cause of action from Wisniewski before it considered issues of liability and damages. The jury instructions defined “fraudulent concealment” as follows:\n“a) Affirmative acts or representations made by the defendant that were designed to prevent and, in fact, did prevent! ] plaintiff from discovering his claim against the defendant; or\nb) The defendant failed to disclose all material facts concerning the existence of plaintiffs cause of action against the defendant and there was a special relationship that existed between plaintiff and defendant whereby the plaintiff placed trust and confidence in defendant thereby placing defendant in a position of influence and superiority over plaintiff.”\nThe jury instructions further stated that Wisniewski had the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the Diocese fraudulently concealed his cause of action and that he commenced his cause of action against the Diocese within five years of discovering it. As noted above, the Diocese does not take issue with the jury instructions, and we believe that Wisniewski presented evidence from which the jury could find in his favor on the issue of fraudulent concealment as defined in the jury instructions.\nThe first prong of the jury instruction defining fraudulent concealment stated that fraudulent concealment included “acts or representations made by the defendant that were designed to prevent and, in fact, did prevent! ] plaintiff from discovering his claim against the defendant.” The Diocese maintains that, as a matter of law, evidence of acts or representations its officers made with respect to Kownacki’s qualifications to be a priest after Wisniewski left the Salem parish in 1980 cannot support the jury’s finding of fraudulent concealment because there was no evidence presented that Wisniewski was aware of the officers’ acts or representations that occurred after he left the Salem parish. With respect to the affirmative representations made by Kownacki, i.e., that the abuse was a good thing that helped the priest, the Diocese argues that Wisniewski did not present any evidence that any officer or principal of the Diocese knew of Kownacki’s representations to Wisniewski at the time he made them. Therefore, the Diocese concludes, Kownacki’s representations to Wisniewski cannot constitute affirmative acts of fraudulent concealment on the part of the Diocese as defined under the first prong of the fraudulent concealment definition. See Barbour v. South Chicago Community Hospital, 156 Ill. App. 3d 324, 330-31, 509 N.E.2d 558, 563 (1987) (“Illinois courts, including the supreme court, have refused to expand *** section 13 — 215 to include an unknowing principal.”).\nWe need not determine whether Wisniewski presented sufficient evidence to establish fraudulent concealment under the first prong of the definition instruction because we hold that Wisniewski presented sufficient evidence to establish fraudulent concealment under the second prong of the definition instruction. See, e.g., Krklus v. Stanley, 359 Ill. App. 3d 471, 479, 833 N.E.2d 952, 959 (2005) (when there is a general verdict after more than one theory has been presented to a jury, the verdict will be upheld on appeal if there was sufficient evidence to sustain any of the theories presented).\nThe second prong of the fraudulent concealment definition instruction stated that fraudulent concealment occurs if the “defendant failed to disclose all material facts concerning the existence of plaintiff’s cause of action against the defendant and there was a special relationship that existed between plaintiff and defendant whereby the plaintiff placed trust and confidence in defendant thereby placing defendant in a position of influence and superiority over plaintiff.” In challenging a finding of fraudulent concealment under the second prong of the definition instruction, the Diocese argues that, as a matter of law, it did not have a special relationship with Wisniewski or occupy a position of trust. We disagree. We believe that the issue of whether a relationship of trust existed between Wisniewski and the Diocese was not an issue to be decided by the court as a matter of law but was a factual issue that was properly submitted to the jury to decide.\na.\nEvidence of a Special Relationship That Placed the Diocese and Its Officers and Agents in a Position of Influence and Superiority Over Wisniewski\nThe jury heard evidence that the Diocese, its officers, its priests, and its parish in Salem, Illinois, played a central role in Wisniewski’s life from the time his parents first moved to Salem when he was a young boy and throughout his childhood. The family was very active in church life, and Wisniewski and his siblings were taught to obey and believe everything the Diocese’s bishops, monsignors, and priests said to them. Wisniewski was an active parishioner and an altar boy and was taught to trust and respect the Diocese and put his faith and trust in its agents and employees. He attended the Diocese’s Catholic grade school for a number of years, worked around the parish, and expressed interest in becoming a Catholic priest.\nThe agents and employees of the Diocese were held in high esteem in Wisniewski’s family and were placed on a pedestal, and the Diocese itself fostered, promoted, and encouraged this trusting relationship by urging its parishioners to trust their priests’ “knowledge, piety, prudence, experience, and general character.” In fact, when the Diocese appointed Kownacki to the parish in Salem, the bishop, as the Diocese’s CEO, “command[ed] all, whom it may concern, to recognize [Kownacki] as such Pastor and grant [him] all necessary assistance.” The Diocese successfully garnered this trust with Wisniewski’s parents and with Wisniewski, and it is this very trust that Kownacki exploited in order to sexually abuse Wisniewski for years. The Diocese’s assertion that the evidence was insufficient for the jury to conclude that it held a position of trust over Wisniewski is entirely unconvincing. The evidence overwhelmingly established that Wisniewski placed his trust and confidence in the Diocese and that the Diocese not only accepted that trust and confidence but encouraged and promoted it.\nThe Diocese argues that Illinois courts and public policy do not recognize any duty, fiduciary or otherwise, between a parishioner and his pastor. The Diocese cites three cases in support of this argument: Dausch v. Rykse, 52 F.3d 1425, 1438-39 (7th Cir. 1994) (per curiam), Maryland Casualty Co. v. Havey, 887 F. Supp. 195, 200 (C.D. Ill. 1995), and Amato v. Greenquist, 287 Ill. App. 3d 921, 931-32, 679 N.E.2d 446, 453-54 (1997). These cases are not persuasive in the present case because they do not analyze the relationship between a parishioner and a priest or a diocese in terms of applying the fraudulent concealment statute.\nIn Amato, the plaintiff sued a pastor, a bishop, and a church organization for psychotherapy malpractice and a breach of a fiduciary duty after the plaintiff received marriage counseling from the pastor at the same time the pastor was having an affair with the plaintiffs wife. Amato, 287 Ill. App. 3d at 923, 679 N.E.2d at 448. The trial court dismissed the plaintiffs complaint for various reasons but primarily because Illinois did not recognize the tort of clergy malpractice and because the relationship between cleric and parishioner was not a fiduciary one. Amato, 287 Ill. App. 3d at 924, 679 N.E.2d at 449.\nOn appeal, the Amato court held that the first amendment “prohibited the recognition of an action for breach of fiduciary duty premised upon the counselling relationship between a cleric and a church member with whom the cleric had been sexually involved.” Amato, 287 Ill. App. 3d at 932, 679 N.E.2d at 454 (citing Dausch v. Rykse, 52 F.3d 1425, 1438 (7th Cir. 1994) (per curiam)). The court recognized that the relationship between a cleric and a parishioner “reflects many aspects of a fiduciary one,” but it held that under Illinois law, a contention that a cleric has breached his duty as a fiduciary is not actionable because religion is the foundation for that claim. Amato, 287 Ill. App. 3d at 932, 679 N.E.2d at 454. The court noted that in Illinois the courts have refused to entertain similar claims of “clergy malpractice” because “the first amendment’s free exercise clause prohibits courts from considering claims requiring the interpretation of religious doctrine.” Amato, 287 Ill. App. 3d at 925-26, 679 N.E.2d at 450.\nIn Maryland Casualty Co., the court had to determine an insurance company’s duty to defend a complaint filed by parishioners against a priest and the Diocese of Springfield. Maryland Casualty Co., 887 F. Supp. at 196. The complaint alleged that the priest sexually abused the parishioners when they were approximately 11 or 12 years old. Maryland Casualty Co., 887 F. Supp. at 196. In analyzing whether the parishioners could recover under a theory that the priest negligently breached his duties as a priest, the court stated, “Illinois courts have refused to create a legally recognized duty between clergymen and their congregation.” Maryland Casualty Co., 887 F. Supp. at 200 (citing Dausch v. Rykse, 52 F.3d 1425 (7th Cir. 1994) (per curiam)). The court concluded that without that duty, the parishioners could not maintain an action for the negligent infliction of emotional distress or for the breach of a fiduciary duty. Therefore, the insurance company did not have a duty to defend those claims because they did not state a claim for which relief could be granted. Maryland Casualty Co., 887 F. Supp. at 200.\nIn Dausch, a member of a church’s congregation filed a claim against the church and its pastor, alleging that the pastor improperly engaged in sexual relations with her when she sought counseling. Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1427. The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the pastor “held himself out *** to be a duly qualified person engaged in providing psychological counseling” and committed “professional negligence” by engaging in “sexual relations” with her during counseling sessions. Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1427-28. The trial court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint for a failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1428.\nOn appeal, the Dausch court noted that Illinois has rejected a cause of action for clergy malpractice because the evaluation of those claims would require the courts to evaluate religious tenets. Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1432 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). However, the court also noted that the courts’ refusal to examine the conduct of the clergy “has not been extended to situations in which the conduct in question does not bear such a direct relationship to the doctrinal or organizational aspects of religious practice.” Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1432 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Illinois allows judicial scrutiny of the conduct of clergy that “does not implicate judicial assessment of the tenets of a particular religion or a determination of whether a particular litigant has adhered to those tenets.” Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1433 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Under those circumstances, the sole inquiry is whether the individual has engaged in conduct that the state has deemed harmful. Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1433 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). In other words, “[t]ort claims for behavior by a cleric that does not require the examination of religious doctrine are cognizable.” Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1433 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nIn addressing the plaintiff’s allegation that the defendants breached a fiduciary duty they owed to her, the Dausch court held that alleging a breach of a fiduciary relationship “was simply an elliptical way of alleging clergy malpractice.” Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1438 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The court stated, “If the court were to recognize such a breach of fiduciary duty, it would be required to define a reasonable duty standard and to evaluate [the pastor’s] conduct against that standard, an inquiry identical to that which Illinois has declined to undertake in the context of a clergy malpractice claim and one that is of doubtful validity under the Free Exercise Clause.” Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1438 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nThe present issue is distinguishable from the issues in Amato, Maryland Casualty Co., and Dausch because the issue in the present case is not whether Wisniewski can maintain a cause of action against the Diocese for clergy malpractice. Instead, the issue is whether there was a special relationship between Wisniewski and the Diocese for purposes of the fraudulent concealment statute, and the analysis of that issue does not involve any judicial analysis of religious doctrine or whether the Diocese adhered to religious tenets. As the court in Amato stated, the relationship between a priest and a parishioner reflects many aspects of a special or fiduciary relationship Amato, 287 Ill. App. 3d at 932, 679 N.E.2d at 454), and it is those aspects of the relationship that are relevant to the application of the fraudulent concealment statute to the facts of the present case.\nA determination that a special relationship existed between Wisniewski and the Diocese did not require the court or the jury to engage in interpretation of religious doctrine, but only to determine whether Wisniewski placed his trust and confidence in the Diocese, thereby placing the Diocese in a position of influence and superiority over him. The jury’s determination of this issue did not implicate the free exercise clause of the first amendment. The jury was asked to determine whether the special relationship existed and, if so, whether the Diocese failed to disclose all material facts concerning the existence of Wisniewski’s claim against it. To invoke the protection of the first amendment, the Diocese must assert that the conduct at issue was “rooted in religious belief.” Sanders v. Casa View Baptist Church, 134 F.3d 331, 337-38 (5th Cir. 1998). The Diocese does not and cannot contend that its silence about the abuse committed by Kownacki was a part of Catholic religious beliefs and practices. On the contrary, the evidence at the trial established that the Diocese considered Wisniewski’s abuse as “dirty laundry” that it did not want to hang out in public.\nFurthermore, contrary to the Diocese’s assertion on appeal, in affirming the circuit court’s denial of its motion for a judgment n.o.v., we are not required to hold that the Diocese has a special or fiduciary relationship, as a matter of law, with all of its parishioners. Instead, we hold that it was an issue of fact for the jury to decide. Consistent with the established standard of review for the denial of a motion for a judgment n.o.v., we hold that the jury in the present case was entitled to find, based on the evidence presented at the trial, that the Diocese held a position of trust and confidence with Wisniewski for purposes of the application of the fraudulent concealment statute.\nb.\nThe Diocese’s Failure to Disclose All Material Facts Concerning the Existence of Wisniewski’s Cause of Action Against It\nSince the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that the Diocese held a special relationship with Wisniewski, the next step in our analysis under the second prong of the fraudulent concealment definition instruction is to determine whether the jury could have concluded that the Diocese failed to disclose all material facts concerning Wisniewski’s claim against it in light of the special relationship. As noted above, the Diocese argues that Kownacki’s fraudulent representations that the sexual abuse was good and helpful to the priest do not constitute affirmative acts or representations attributable to the Diocese to support a finding of fraudulent concealment under the first prong of the definition instruction because there was no evidence that it was aware of the representations at the time they were made. However, under the facts of this case, the jury could, nonetheless, find that the Diocese’s silence after it learned that Wisniewski was abused by Kownacki constituted fraudulent concealment of Wisniewski’s cause of action under the second prong of the definition instruction.\nThe jury learned that the Diocese became aware of Kownacki’s abuse of Wisniewski as early as 1982 when the parents of the freshman boy reported to the Diocese’s officers at the chancery that their son had been abused by Kownacki. The parents reported that Kownacki represented to their son that the abuse was okay and was “a sign of friendship.” Kownacki made the freshman boy promise not to tell his parents and told the boy that he had done the same thing with Wisniewski. The jury also considered evidence that the Diocese was aware that in the 1970s Kownacki abused Gina and did so by telling her that the sexual abuse was acceptable in the eyes of God and the Church.\nAccordingly, the jury heard evidence that, in 1982, the officers of the Diocese were aware that Kownacki had sexually abused several minor parishioners, including Wisniewski, and, importantly, that a crucial element of Kownacki’s method of abuse was positive coercion, i.e., representations that the abuse was a good thing. The Diocese was aware that Kownacki made those representations as a Diocesan priest and that he used his position as its priest as an inroad for facilitating his abuse and for lending credibility to the false representations he made to his victims. In other words, the Diocese was aware that Kownacki made misrepresentations to his child victims concerning the nature of the sexual abuse, using the Diocese’s special relationship with its child parishioners to influence his victims into believing that the abuse was a good thing. This evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that the Diocese’s special relationship with Wisniewski as a St. Theresa’s parishioner created an affirmative duty on the part of the Diocese to contact Wisniewski about Kownacki’s abuse and disavow Kownacki’s representations that his abuse was good and helpful to the priest. The Diocese, however, remained silent. Considering the instructions given to the jury and viewing the evidence in light most favorable to Wisniewski, the evidence was more than sufficient for the jury to find that the Diocese’s continued silence after learning that Wisniewski was abused was the equivalent of an affirmative act of fraudulent concealment of Wisniewski’s claim against it.\nc.\nThe Diocese’s Silence Prevented Wisniewski From (1) Discovering That He Sustained an Injury and (2) Discovering That the Diocese’s Wrongful Conduct Caused His Injuries\nThe next step in our analysis is to determine whether the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that the Diocese’s silence prevented Wisniewski from discovering his claim until 2002. The fraudulent concealment must have lulled Wisniewski into delaying the filing of his claim or prevented him from discovering his claim. See Smith v. Cook County Hospital, 164 Ill. App. 3d 857, 862, 518 N.E.2d 336, 340 (1987). We believe that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that the Diocese’s fraudulent concealment by silence prevented Wisniewski from discovering his claim until 2002.\nOn the issue of when Wisniewski discovered his claim, the jury was instructed as follows:\n“The plaintiff is deemed to have discovered his cause of action when he both:\n1) Knows or should have known that he has sustained an injury; and\n2) That the injury was caused by the wrongful conduct of the defendant.”\nWith respect to the first prong of this definition instruction, Wisniewski presented evidence from which the jury could find that he did not know and should not have known that he sustained any injury from Kownacki’s abuse until 2002 when the Boston priest scandal became national news and that the Diocese’s silence prevented him from discovering his injuries before that time.\nThe evidence supported a finding that the specific injury that Wisniewski suffered was posttraumatic stress disorder that first manifested itself in January of 2002. A psychiatrist who examined Wisniewski, Dr. Peterson, testified that prior to 2002, Wisniewski did not exhibit any criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder because, in part, Wisniewski came to believe that Kownacki’s representations were correct and that he helped the priest by submitting to the abuse. The psychiatrist told the jury that Wisniewski accepted that Kownacki’s abuse was a good thing and that a major part of Wisniewski’s psychological defense mechanism was believing that what happened was helpful to the priest. In 2002, however, the news stories of child sexual abuse by Boston priests overwhelmed Wisniewski’s defenses, and he then, for the first time, began suffering from the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, including nightmares, depression, loss of energy and focus, difficulty sleeping, persistent suicidal thoughts, and recollections about his abuse that interfered with his everyday life. Peterson testified that in his opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, in 2002, Wisniewski first became aware that he had sustained an injury as a result of the repeated acts of sexual molestation committed by the Diocese’s priest.\nLikewise, another psychiatrist, Dr. Kopacz, testified that there was no indication in Wisniewski’s history after he left the Salem parish of any significant problems in functioning or coping in his fife until the media coverage of the Boston priest scandal in early 2002. Kopacz explained to the jury that, as a child, Wisniewski was very submissive and was programmed to believe everything Kownacki said, which allowed Kownacki to manipulate Wisniewski’s sense of reality. However, the media coverage of the Boston scandal overwhelmed Wisniewski, and he began experiencing posttraumatic stress disorder.\nThe jury could have concluded from this evidence that the Diocese’s fraudulent concealment by silence after it learned of Wisniewski’s abuse prevented Wisniewski from discovering his injuries until 2002. The Diocese, having knowledge of Kownacki’s abuse and false representations in 1982, failed to contact Wisniewski and address the abuse or address Kownacki’s representations concerning the nature of the abuse Kownacki made as its priest. The jury could have found this evidence particularly compelling given (1) the special relationship that existed between the Diocese and Wisniewski, (2) that Kownacki’s manipulation of Wisniewski’s perception of reality occurred when Wisniewski was a young and impressionable parishioner, and (3) that Kownacki exploited the Diocese’s special relationship with Wisniewski in order to abuse Wisniewski and manipulate his sense of reality. Under these facts, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find in Wisniewski’s favor on the issue of when he is deemed to have discovered his cause of action.\nFurthermore, under the second prong of the jury instruction that defined when Wisniewski is deemed to have discovered his claim, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that Wisniewski had no reason to know of or suspect any wrongdoing by the Diocese prior to 2002. There was no evidence to suggest that Wisniewski was aware or should have been aware that the officers of the Diocese actually knew of Kownacki’s pedophile tendencies when it appointed him as the parish priest and knew of Kownacki’s use of false representations as a positive coercion tactic to facilitate his abuse.\nWe find Chicago Park District v. Kenroy, Inc., 78 Ill. 2d 555, 563, 402 N.E.2d 181, 185 (1980), instructive in analyzing the circuit court’s denial of the Diocese’s motion for a judgment n.o.v. on the issue of fraudulent concealment. In Chicago Park District, a park district initiated eminent domain proceedings to acquire a parcel of real property owned by the defendants. Prior to the proceedings, however, the defendants bribed a city alderman to rezone the property, which increased its value by $5 million. Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 559, 402 N.E.2d at 183. The City of Chicago and the park district did not discover the fraud until several years later, after which they brought a lawsuit against the defendants, alleging the fraud and seeking the imposition of a constructive trust and to recover actual and punitive damages. Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 559-60, 402 N.E.2d at 183-84. The defendants raised the applicable statute of limitations, and one of the issues on appeal was whether the complaint adequately alleged fraudulent concealment sufficient to toll the statute of limitations. Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 560, 402 N.E.2d at 184.\nIn holding that the complaint sufficiently pled fraudulent concealment, the court initially noted that silence ordinarily does not constitute fraudulent concealment, but when a person who is in a position of trust remains silent when he ought to speak, he can be found to have fraudulently concealed. Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 562, 402 N.E.2d at 185. The court stated that the alderman who took the bribe occupied a fiduciary relationship with the city. Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 562, 402 N.E.2d at 185. The court further stated that according to the allegations in the complaint, “there was no apparent reason for the City to suspect that its fiduciary *** had entered into a scheme of bribery and fraud with the defendants until it became apparent during” the alderman’s prosecution for failing to report bribes on his income taxes. Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 562, 402 N.E.2d at 185. In ruling that the defendants could not utilize the statute of limitations to “protect their allegedly ill-gotten gains,” the court stated, “To hold that the City was obliged to search for the misfeasance of its duly elected public official, absent a prior indication of wrongdoing, would require it to presume unfaithfulness on the part of its fiduciary.” Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 563, 402 N.E.2d at 185-86.\nLikewise, in the present case, the jury was presented with evidence of a relationship of trust between the Diocese and Wisniewski, with Wisniewski placing his trust and confidence in the Diocese, its agents, and its employees. The evidence further supported a finding that Wisniewski had no reason to suspect that the Diocese, in fact, knew of Kownacki’s history of abusing the Diocese’s relationship of trust with its parishioners in order to commit child sexual abuse. When the Diocese learned of Wisniewski’s sexual abuse, it remained silent, and Wisniewski had no reason to suspect that the Diocese betrayed his trust and confidence. Under these circumstances, we will not second-guess the jury’s verdict.\nThe Diocese argues that even if there was a relationship of trust and confidence between it and Wisniewski, the fraudulent concealment statute did not relieve Wisniewski of the obligation to investigate the Diocese’s wrongdoing. See Dancor International, Ltd. v. Friedman, Goldberg &amp; Mintz, 288 Ill. App. 3d 666, 676, 681 N.E.2d 617, 624 (1997) (the fraudulent concealment statute does not apply to a party who, through the exercise of ordinary diligence, could have discovered the concealed information). The Diocese notes that Wisniewski always remembered that the sexual abuse occurred, knew the identity of his abuser, and knew that his abuser was a priest of the Diocese. The Diocese concludes, therefore, that as a matter of law Wisniewski always had sufficient notice of his cause of action against it regardless of any fraudulent concealment by silence. We disagree.\n“Whether the injured person has become possessed of sufficient information concerning his or her injury and its cause to put a reasonable person on inquiry to determine whether actionable conduct is involved is usually a question of fact.” Pruitt v. Schultz, 235 Ill. App. 3d 934, 936, 601 N.E.2d 1372, 1374 (1992). In the present case, the jury found, based upon the evidence presented at the trial, that Wisniewski commenced his action within five years of the time he knew or should have known (1) that he sustained an injury and (2) that the injury was caused by the wrongful conduct of the Diocese. The factual issue of when Wisniewski is deemed to have discovered his injury was properly submitted to the jury, and for the reasons explained above, we believe that the evidence supports the jury’s finding in Wisniewski’s favor on that issue. We cannot say that only one conclusion could be drawn on undisputed facts; therefore, the question was “best left for [the jury].” Pruitt, 235 Ill. App. 3d at 936-37, 601 N.E.2d at 1375.\nIn support of its argument that Wisniewski had sufficient notice to prevent the application of the fraudulent concealment statute, the Diocese cites a number of cases from other jurisdictions, including Doe v. Archdiocese of Cincinnati, 2006 — Ohio—2625, 849 N.E.2d 268, Baselice v. Franciscan Friars Assumption BVM Province, Inc., 2005 PA Super 246, 879 A.2d 270, and Cevenini v. Archbishop of Washington, 707 A.2d 768 (D.C. 1998).\nIn Archdiocese of Cincinnati, the plaintiff was a victim of child sexual abuse by a priest that occurred from 1980 through 1983. Archdiocese of Cincinnati, 2006 — Ohio—2625, at ¶3, 849 N.E.2d at 270-71. The plaintiff filed a lawsuit against the archdiocese in 2004 after he learned that the priest had abused other victims. Id. at ¶5, 849 N.E.2d at 271. The plaintiff alleged that before he learned about the other victims, he had no reason to believe that the archdiocese had known about the priest’s abuse. Id. at ¶4, 849 N.E.2d at 271. The court, however, noted that the plaintiff “knew the identity of his alleged perpetrator and knew the employer of his alleged perpetrator.” Id. at ¶47, 849 N.E.2d at 279. Therefore, in holding that the plaintiffs claim was time-barred as a matter of law, the court stated that the plaintiff “had all of the facts necessary to investigate and prosecute his potential causes of action against the archdiocese.” Id. at ¶47, 849 N.E.2d at 279.\nSimilarly, in Baselice, the court noted that the plaintiff “knew he was injured, knew the identity of the primary cause of his injury, and knew his abuser was an employee of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, yet [the plaintiff] conducted no investigation into any *** aspect of the matter.” Baselice, 2005 PA Super 246, ¶19, 879 A.2d 270. The court concluded that, as a matter of law, “[t]hese facts alone were sufficient to put [the plaintiff] on notice that there was a possibility that the Archdiocese had been negligent.” Baselice, 2005 PA Super 246, ¶19, 879 A.2d 270.\nIn Cevenini, the plaintiffs were sexually abused by a priest when they were teenagers in the mid-1970s. Cevenini, 707 A.2d at 770. The plaintiffs filed a complaint against the archdiocese in 1995 after a newspaper published a series of articles disclosing that the archdiocese knew of the priest’s pedophilic tendencies before he was assigned to the plaintiffs’ church. Cevenini, 707 A.2d at 770. The plaintiffs maintained that they had no knowledge of the archdiocese’s wrongdoing until the publication of the newspaper articles. Cevenini, 707 A.2d at 770. In holding that the claims were untimely as a matter of law, the Cevenini court stated the plaintiffs were aware that it was the archdiocese that assigned the priest to their church and that the priest was a “subordinate representative” of the archdiocese. Cevenini, 707 A.2d at 773. In addition, the abuse occurred on church premises while the priest was functioning as a representative of the archdiocese. The court concluded that under these circumstances, “a reasonable plaintiff would have investigated his potential claims against the Archdiocese at the same time that his claims accrued against its representative.” Cevenini, 707 A.2d at 773.\nIn the recent case of Doe v. Catholic Bishop for the Diocese of Memphis, 306 S.W.3d 712 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2008), the court analyzed similar cases from different jurisdictions, including Archdiocese of Cincinnati and Cevenini, and concluded that there were two views on this issue. The court cited Archdiocese of Cincinnati and Cevenini as examples of an “apparent majority” of courts that hold “as a matter of law that the plaintiff, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, would have discovered the defendant church’s knowledge of the clergy member’s prior acts of abuse, and that the plaintiffs lawsuit against the church is time-barred.” Catholic Bishop for the Diocese of Memphis, 306 S.W.3d at 722. The court also stated that a “minority of courts” have held that “a fact issue exists as to whether the plaintiff, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, would have discovered the church’s alleged knowledge of the prior sexual abuse.” Catholic Bishop for the Diocese of Memphis, 306 S.W3d at 722.\nAs an example of the “minority” cases, the Catholic Bishop for the Diocese of Memphis court cited A.L.M. v. Diocese of Allentown, 68 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th 111 (2004), and Matthews v. Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th 393 (2004). In A.L.M., the plaintiffs alleged that they were sexually abused by priests when they were minors between 1965 and 1982. A.L.M., 68 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 114-15. In 2004, they filed suit against the diocese and the bishop but not against the offending priests. A.L.M., 68 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 114-15. The plaintiffs maintained that they were unable to discover that the diocese was a cause of their injuries until 2002 when representatives of the diocese disclosed that they had knowledge of prior incidents of child sexual abuse by the clergy members. A.L.M., 68 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 117. The plaintiffs’ claims were not based on the vicarious liability of an employer. A.L.M., 68 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 124.\nThe A.L.M. court held that there was a factual issue concerning when the plaintiffs knew or should have known that the defendants were a cause of their harm. A.L.M., 68 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 124. The court stated, “Although the plaintiffs knew of their injuries and of the priests who abused them many years ago, if the plaintiffs’ allegations are correct, a question remains as to when the plaintiffs knew or had reason to know that the defendants were also a cause of their harm.” A.L.M., 68 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 124. “Based on the allegations in the complaints, this did not occur until 2002, when disclosures by church officials alerted the plaintiffs to a conspiracy within the church to conceal sexual abuse against minors.” A.L.M., 68 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 125.\nSimilarly, in Matthews, the plaintiff alleged that he was sexually abused by a priest in 1989 when he was 12 years old. Matthews, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 395. In 2004, he brought a lawsuit against his diocese after learning that the diocese had a policy of shielding and protecting priests engaged in child sexual abuse. Matthews, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 395. He alleged that prior to that time, he had no reason to suspect that the diocese would have permitted the priest to continue to minister once the diocese discovered that the priest had a history of sexually molesting children. Matthews, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 395. The court noted that the plaintiffs claims were not based on a theory of respondeat superior. Matthews, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 395. Instead, the claims were based on allegations that, after the diocese had notice of complaints concerning the priest molesting other children, it allowed the priest to continue to serve at the plaintiffs church, ministering to minor parishioners. Matthews, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 395-96.\nThe Matthews court held that a jury should decide the issue of when the plaintiff knew or should have known of his cause of action. Matthews, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 407. The court rejected CeveninVs holding that, as a matter of a law, at the time of the abuse, a plaintiff should have reason to suspect that the diocese may also have independent responsibility for the abuse. The court did not find CeveninVs rationale to be persuasive because “the employer is a church which the plaintiff attends and the employee is engaging in activity that may be reasonably viewed as conduct that the church could never tolerate.” Matthews, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 407. The Matthews court stated, “A jury may find that there is a loud ring of truth to plaintiffs statement that he and his family never approached Diocesan officials to ask whether they had knowingly assigned to their church, to work directly with the parishioners, including young boys, a priest with a history of sexually molesting children, because it would never cross their minds that the church would do so.” Matthews, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 407. The court emphasized that reasonable minds could differ and that the jury was not required to find that the plaintiff and his family should have considered the possibility that the diocese knowingly assigned a pedophile as their church’s priest. Matthews, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 407.\nWe find the reasoning in A.L.M. and Matthews to be persuasive under the facts of the present case. Similar to the facts in A.L.M. and Matthews, Wisniewski’s claims against the Diocese were not based on respondeat superior but were based on the allegations that the Diocese knowingly installed a pedophile priest at the Salem parish. In addition, similar to A.L.M. and Matthews, the jury in the present case was entitled to find that Wisniewski had no reason to suspect that the Diocese intentionally assigned to the Salem parish a priest with a history of child sexual abuse.\nAs noted above, in Chicago Park District, the Illinois Supreme Court held that the City of Chicago had no reason to suspect that its fiduciary, a city alderman, “had entered into a scheme of bribery and fraud with the defendants” and that “[t]o hold that the City was obliged to search for misfeasance of its duly elected public official, absent a prior indication of wrongdoing, would require it to presume unfaithfulness on the part of its fiduciary.” Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 562-63, 402 N.E.2d at 185. Likewise, in the present case, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that Wisniewski was under no obligation to search for wrongdoing by the Diocese when Kownacki was engaged in activities that may be reasonably viewed as conduct that the Diocese would never tolerate. The jury was entitled to find that Wisniewski was not required to presume such unfaithfulness on the part of the Diocese. Therefore, the trial court properly submitted the question of when Wisniewski is deemed to have discovered his claim to the jury as a factual issue, rather than deciding the issue in the Diocese’s favor as a matter of law. See also Turner v. Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington, Vermont, 2009 VT 101, ¶56, 987 A.2d 960 (the issue of whether the plaintiff was on inquiry notice of the diocese’s potential liability of church leadership was an issue for the jury).\nFurthermore, as noted above, there are two prongs of the factual analysis for when Wisniewski is deemed to have discovered his claim. With respect to the first prong of the definition instruction concerning when Wisniewski is deemed to have discovered his cause of action, the only evidence presented to tjhe jury in the present case concerning when Wisniewski knew or shquld have known that he sustained an injury came from Dr. Peterson. The trial court in the present case would have erred if it had taken this factual decision away from the jury and decided the issue as a. matter of law by granting the Diocese’s motion for a judgment n.o.v:\nThe Diocese also cites Clay v. Kuhl, 189 Ill. 2d 603, 727 N.E.2d 217 (2000), and Parks v. Kownacki, 193 Ill. 2d 164, 737 N.E.2d 287 (2000), in support of its argument. We believe that Clay and Parks are distinguishable from the present case.\nIn Clay, the plaintiff was born in 1964, and she alleged that a clergyman began sexually abusing her in 1972 or 1973 and continued abusing her for seven years. Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 605, 727 N.E.2d at 219. In January of 1996, the plaintiff filed a complaint against the clergyman and the religious order that had hired him. Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 605, 727 N.E.2d at 219. Similar to the present case, the plaintiff in Clay alleged that the religious order had notice of similar misconduct committed by the clergyman but failed to take any steps to prevent the abuse she endured. Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 605, 727 N.E.2d at 219. The supreme court held that, as a matter of law, the plaintiffs allegations were untimely. Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 610, 727 N.E.2d at 221.\nIn Clay, the plaintiffs complaint alleged that the plaintiffs life was on a “tragic course” and that she did not realize that it was based, at least in part, on the abuse. Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 609, 727 N.E.2d at 221. In ruling that the plaintiffs action was untimely as a matter of law, the court noted that the “plaintiff had sufficient information about her injury and its cause to require her to bring suit long before the date of discovery alleged in the complaint.” Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 610, 727 N.E.2d at 221. The court held that the plaintiffs alleged failure to fully discover the nature of her injuries was insufficient to delay the running of the limitations period. Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 610, 727 N.E.2d at 222.\nThe Clay court distinguished the plaintiffs claim from tort actions arising from exposure to asbestos. Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 612, 727 N.E.2d at 222. The court stated that there were “substantial distinctions between cases involving exposure to asbestos or other dangerous substances, in which the risk of harm is not immediately apparent, and cases involving events that give rise to an immediate awareness of injury.” Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 612, 727 N.E.2d at 222. The court concluded that in asbestos cases, “ ‘the plaintiffs did not discover that they suffered any injury until long after the tortious conduct occurred.’ ” (Emphasis in original.) Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 612, 727 N.E.2d at 222 (quoting Golla v. General Motors Corp., 167 Ill. 2d 353, 367, 657 N.E.2d 894, 901 (1995)).\nThe facts of the present case are distinguishable from Clay because, in Clay, the plaintiff alleged that she suffered from subsequent psychological problems as a result of the abuse but merely failed to realize a causal connection between the problems and the abuse. Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 609-10, 727 N.E.2d at 221. In the present case, Wisniewski did not suffer any psychological problems until 2002. His life was not on a “tragic course” as was alleged in the complaint in Clay. Accordingly, the facts of the present case are more analogous to those cases noted by the Clay court in which the plaintiffs did not discover any injury until long after the tortious conduct occurred. The facts of the present case were certainly close enough for reasonable minds to differ. Furthermore, the Clay decision does not analyze any facts in that case relevant to the second prong of the determination of when a plaintiff is deemed to have discovered his claim. Under the second prong, for the reasons discussed above, there was sufficient evidence presented in the present case for the jury to determine the factual issue of when Wisniewski knew or should have known that the Diocese’s wrongful conduct caused his injuries.\nAccordingly, we find Clay to be distinguishable. A court of review “should not usurp the function of the jury and substitute its judgment on questions of fact fairly submitted, tried, and determined from the evidence which did not greatly preponderate either way.” Maple v. Gustafson, 151 Ill. 2d 445, 452-53, 603 N.E.2d 508, 512 (1992). We cannot “reweigh the evidence and set aside a verdict merely because the jury could have drawn different inferences or conclusions, or because the court feels that other results are more reasonable.” Maple, 151 Ill. 2d at 452, 603 N.E.2d at 512.\nLikewise, Parks is distinguishable from the present case. In Parks, the plaintiff was the 14-year-old girl we described in the background section above, Gina, who was abused by Kownacki when he was the priest in St. Francisville and in Washington Park in the early 1970s. In 1995, Gina filed a lawsuit against Kownacki and the Diocese, and the defendants raised the statute of limitations and the statute of repose as a defense to Gina’s claim. Parks, 193 Ill. 2d at 167, 737 N.E.2d at 289-90. The trial court dismissed Gina’s complaint as untimely under both the statute of limitations and the statute of repose. Parks, 193 Ill. 2d at 167, 737 N.E.2d at 289-90.\nIn determining when the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known that she sustained an injury, the Parks court noted as follows: “While she alleges that she did not know that the sexual relationship was wrong, it is clear from her actions — telling her parents, reporting Kownacki to [the bishop] — that she knew that Kownacki had wronged her.” Parks, 193 Ill. 2d at 177, 737 N.E.2d at 294-95. The court stated, “Although plaintiff was not aware of her post[ ]traumatic stress disorder until recently, one particular injury that plaintiff claims, the forced abortion, obviously was apparent when plaintiff went to the hospital and was given dilation and curettage.” Parks, 193 Ill. 2d at 177-78, 737 N.E.2d at 295.\nIn the present case, however, the only evidence presented at the trial concerning when Wisniewski discovered his injuries came from Dr. Peterson, who testified that Wisniewski did not begin suffering posttraumatic stress disorder until 2002. Unlike Parks, in the present case, there was no evidence that Wisniewski suffered from any physical injuries as a result of the abuse.\nWe do not believe that the Clay or Parks decision allows us to set aside the jury’s finding of fraudulent concealment in the present case. Under the facts presented at the trial, viewed in the light most favorable to Wisniewski, the jury could have concluded that the Diocese, through its officers, fraudulently concealed Wisniewski’s claim against it by its silence, as defined under the second prong of the fraudulent concealment definition instruction. The jury was entitled to find that Wisniewski timely brought his cause of action against the Diocese within five years after discovering his cause of action in 2002. See 735 ILCS 5/13 — 215 (West 2008). We cannot conclude that “all of the evidence, when viewed in its aspect most favorable to [Wisniewski], so overwhelmingly favors [the Diocese] that no contrary verdict based on that evidence could ever stand” (Pedrick v. Peoria &amp; Eastern R.R. Co., 37 Ill. 2d 494, 510, 229 N.E.2d 504, 513-14 (1967)). Accordingly, we must affirm the circuit court’s denial of the Diocese’s motion for a judgment n.o.v. on the issue of the Diocese’s fraudulent concealment and the timeliness of Wisniewski’s claim under the statute of repose.\n2.\nCircuit Court’s Finding of Equitable Estoppel and Equitable Tolling\nWhen the circuit court denied the Diocese’s motion for a summary judgment, it ruled that it would separately determine the factual issues relevant to the application of equitable estoppel and equitable tolling. See Vaughn v. Speaker, 126 Ill. 2d 150, 167, 533 N.E.2d 885, 892 (1988) (“the estoppel issue should be determined by a trier of fact other than the jury which may determine the merits of the negligence action” and “may be determined by the circuit court”). While the jury deliberated on the issues of fraudulent concealment, liability, and damages, the circuit court, “after considering all the testimony and evidence” and “assessing the credibility of witnesses,” entered an order finding that Wisniewski’s complaint was “not barred by the statute of limitations or statute of repose based on equitable estoppel and equitable tolling having been established by clear and convincing evidence.” The circuit court found that Wisniewski proved equitable estoppel and equitable tolling by clear and convincing evidence. On appeal, the Diocese takes issue with these findings.\nHowever, we have already determined that the jury properly decided the issue of fraudulent concealment. Equitable estoppel and equitable tolling are alternative theories for tolling the statute of repose. Therefore, we need not separately analyze the circuit court’s finding of equitable estoppel and equitable tolling.\nB.\nStatute of Limitations\nWisniewski raised the fraudulent concealment statute in response to the Diocese’s affirmative defense under the applicable statute of limitations. The jury found in Wisniewski’s favor on the issue of fraudulent concealment, and for the reasons we discussed above, we affirm the circuit court’s denial of the Diocese’s request for a judgment n.o.v. on the issue of fraudulent concealment.\nAs an alternative argument, the Diocese asserts that, under the statute of limitations and the common law discovery rule, Wisniewski’s claim expired in 1981, two years after he turned 18. See 735 ILCS 5/13 — 211 (West 2008); Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 607-08, 727 N.E.2d at 220-21. The Diocese argues, therefore, that the circuit court should have granted it a judgment n.o.v. on the statute of limitations issue. We disagree. We do not believe that the Diocese was entitled to a judgment in its favor as a matter of law under the applicable statute of limitations and the common law discovery rule.\nIn order to analyze the Diocese’s argument that Wisniewski’s claim was untimely under the statute of limitations, we must first determine which particular statute of limitations applies to Wisniewski’s claim. We believe that the general statute of limitations applicable to personal injury claims and the common law discovery rule apply to Wisniewski’s claim.\nPrior to January 1, 1991, claims of personal injury resulting from childhood sexual abuse were governed by the general statute of limitations applicable to personal injury claims. Clay v. Kuhl, 189 Ill. 2d 603, 608, 727 N.E.2d 217, 220-21 (2000). On January 1, 1991, the legislature enacted a two-year statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse cases that incorporated the common law “discovery rule.” Benton v. Vonnahmen, 288 Ill. App. 3d 199, 206, 679 N.E.2d 1270, 1275 (1997) (section 13 — 202.2(b) “codifies [the] common law discovery rule”). Under its express terms, this statute of limitations does not begin to run until the victim “discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should discover” that the abuse occurred and that the abuse caused the personal injury. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 110, par. 13 — 202.2(b).\nOn July 24, 2003, the legislature lengthened the statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse claims and expanded on the statute’s discovery rule language. After the 2003 amendment, section 13— 202.2(b) of the Code provided that actions for damages for personal injury based on childhood sexual abuse must be commenced within 10 years of the abused person’s eighteenth birthday or “within 5 years of the date the person abused discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should discover both (i) that the act of childhood sexual abuse occurred and (ii) that the injury was caused by the childhood sexual abuse.” 735 ILCS 5/13 — 202.2(b) (West 2008). Section 13 — 202.2(b) further states, “Knowledge of the abuse does not constitute discovery of the injury or the causal relationship between any later-discovered injury and the abuse.” 735 ILCS 5/13 — 202.2(b) (West 2008).\nIn the present case, however, if the statute of limitations expired on Wisniewski’s cause of action under the common law discovery rule, it did so in 1981, prior to the enactment of section 13 — 202.2(b) of the Code. Accordingly, in analyzing the timeliness of Wisniewski’s claims under the relevant statute of limitations, we will apply the general statute of limitations applicable to personal injury claims and the common law discovery rule. See Diocese of Dallas, 234 Ill. 2d at 409, 917 N.E.2d at 484.\nThe supreme court has construed the common law discovery rule to activate the running of the statute of limitations when a person knows or reasonably should know of his injury and also knows or reasonably should know that it was wrongfully caused. Golla, 167 Ill. 2d at 360-61, 657 N.E.2d at 898. The question of when the discovery rule activates the running of the statute of limitations is ordinarily a question of fact. County of Du Page v. Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White, Inc., 109 Ill. 2d 143, 153-54, 485 N.E.2d 1076, 1080 (1985).\nThe statute of limitations and common law discovery issues are presented to us in the present case by way of the denial of a motion for a judgment n.o.v. As we noted above, in order to be entitled to a judgment n.o.v., the movant has to establish that “all of the evidence, when viewed in its aspect most favorable to the opponent, so overwhelmingly favors movant that no contrary verdict based on that evidence could ever stand.” Pedrick v. Peoria &amp; Eastern R.R. Co., 37 Ill. 2d 494, 510, 229 N.E.2d 504, 513-14 (1967). In the present case, the evidence was not so overwhelmingly in favor of the Diocese on the factual issues involving the statute of limitations and common law discovery rule that the jury’s verdict cannot stand. Accordingly, we must affirm the circuit court’s denial of the motion for a judgment n.o.v. on those factual issues.\nIn the present case, as noted above, the jury was asked to decide first whether Wisniewski brought his claim within five years of discovering his claim before it could consider the Diocese’s liability and damages. The jury instructions further stated that Wisniewski is deemed to have discovered his claim when he knew or should have known that he sustained an injury and knew or should have known that his injury was caused by wrongful conduct by the Diocese. This definition instruction was identical to the definition of the common law discovery rule. See Golla, 167 Ill. 2d at 360-61, 657 N.E.2d at 898 (the effect of the common law discovery rule is to “postpone the commencement of the relevant statute of limitations until the injured plaintiff knows or reasonably should know that he has been injured and that his injury was wrongfully caused”). The jury found that Wisniewski brought his claim within five years of discovering his claim as defined in the jury instructions. Wisniewski filed his claim against the Diocese in October 2002, and the only evidence Wisniewski presented concerning when he first learned of his injuries and of the Diocese’s wrongful conduct was that he discovered them in 2002. Accordingly, by ruling in his favor on the issue of fraudulent concealment, the jury must have found that Wisniewski filed his claim the same year he discovered his cause of action.\nIn support of its argument that it was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law under the statute of limitations, the Diocese cites Parks and Clay. For the reasons noted above, however, those cases are distinguishable from the facts of the present case. Unlike Parks and Clay, the only evidence presented to the jury in the present case was that Wisniewski was not aware of any injury as a result of the Diocese’s wrongful conduct until 2002, the year he filed his claim. This evidence presented a question of fact for the jury to decide concerning the application of the common law discovery rule. Therefore, we must affirm the circuit court’s denial of the Diocese’s motion for a judgment n.o.v. on the statute of limitations issue.\nII.\nLegal Sufficiency of the Claims\nThe Diocese also argues that the circuit court should have granted its motion for a judgment n.o.v. because Wisniewski’s claims against the Diocese were legally insufficient. The Diocese argues that it did not owe any duty to Wisniewski and, therefore, cannot be found to have breached any such duty. We disagree. The Diocese’s argument that it did not owe any duty to Wisniewski is based on the following incorrect assertion in its brief: “Illinois courts have found that there is no duty or special relationship between a parishioner and his or her pastor, church, or church administration.”\nAs noted above, courts have held that Illinois does not recognize a cause of action for “clergy malpractice” because those actions typically require the courts to interpret religious tenets and that analysis would violate the free exercise clause of the first amendment. However, Illinois allows judicial scrutiny of the actions of clergy that “[do] not implicate judicial assessment of the tenets of a particular religion or a determination of whether a particular litigant has adhered to those tenets.” Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1433 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Under those circumstances, the sole inquiry is whether the individual has engaged in conduct that the state has deemed harmful. Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1433 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). In other words, “[t]ort claims for behavior by a cleric that does not require the examination of religious doctrine are cognizable.” Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1433 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nIn the present case, the Diocese’s assertion that it owed no duty to its Salem parishioners, including Wisniewski, under the facts of this case is entirely false. Wisniewski alleged and proved that the Diocese installed Kownacki as the priest of the parish in Salem at a time when it knew that Kownacki was a pedophile and had violently abused other minors at other parishes. The agents of the Diocese not only kept quiet about Kownacki’s violent pedophile tendencies, but they expressly misrepresented to the Salem parishioners that Kownacki was suitable to minister to and have unsupervised contact with the children of the parish. The CEO of the Diocese, the bishop, directed the unknowing Salem parishioners to put their full faith and trust in Kownacki’s piety, prudence, and character. It is without question that the State of Illinois deems such conduct as harmful, and neither the circuit court nor the jury was required to interpret Catholic religious doctrine to reach that conclusion. The first amendment simply does not shield the Diocese from liability for knowingly installing a child sexual abuser as a parish priest under the facts of this case.\nIn Kigin v. Woodmen of the World Insurance Co., 185 Ill. App. 3d 400, 541 N.E.2d 735 (1989), a camp counselor sexually abused a 15-year-old camper at a youth camp. The camper filed suit against the camp operator who had employed the counselor and knew that the counselor had been intoxicated and had provided alcohol to the plaintiff. In analyzing the sufficiency of the plaintiffs complaint, the court stated that to allow the counselor, a 41-year-old man, “ ‘to be isolated with a 15-year-old girl at a remote location outside the presence of other sober adults’ ” “was a formula for disaster.” Kigin, 185 Ill. App. 3d at 403, 541 N.E.2d at 737. The court held that the complaint sufficiently alleged that the camp operator knew or should have known of the need to exercise control over the counselor. Kigin, 185 Ill. App. 3d at 403, 541 N.E.2d at 737. The court stated that when the camp operator learned that the counselor had become intoxicated, plied the minor with alcohol, and had gone off alone into the woods with the minor at night, the camp operator then had a duty to take steps to protect the plaintiff. Kigin, 185 Ill. App. 3d at 403-04, 541 N.E.2d at 737.\nLikewise, in the present case, the Diocese had knowledge of Kownacki’s propensity to abuse minor children, plying them with alcohol prior to abusing them and telling them the abuse was a good thing. The Diocese placed Kownacki in the position to abuse Wisniewski in the same manner, and the Diocese facilitated and promoted Kownacki’s abuse not only through silence but through affirmative acts of misrepresentation concerning Kownacki’s character. Almost all the abuse Wisniewski described to the jury occurred on church property that Kownacki occupied solely because of his position as a priest of the Diocese. The opportunity for abuse created by the Diocese called for the exercise of control by the Diocese. Its failure to do so is unquestionably actionable in Illinois courts.\nIII.\nRule 215 Motion for Mental Examination\nThe Diocese argues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying its request to perform a mental examination of Wisniewski pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 215 (eff. July 1, 2002). The Diocese disclosed Dr. Moisy Shopper as its expert on June 16, 2008, and on June 24, 2008, it filed a motion for a mental examination of Wisniewski to be completed by Dr. Shopper. On July 3, 2008, the circuit court denied the Diocese’s motion for a mental examination because the motion was “extremely untimely” and because the Diocese did not provide the court with requested information in a timely fashion.\nRule 215(a) provides in part as follows:\n“In any action in which the physical or mental condition of a party *** is in controversy, the court, upon notice and on motion made within a reasonable time before the trial, may order such party to submit to a physical or mental examination by a licensed professional in a discipline related to the physical or mental condition which is involved.” Ill. S. Ct. R. 215(a) (eff. July 1, 2002).\n“The purpose of the rule permitting the court to order a party to submit to physical or mental examination by a physician suggested by the party requesting examination is not to provide an expert witness for the litigant but to permit discovery.” Carlisle v. Harp, 200 Ill. App. 3d 908, 913-14, 558 N.E.2d 318, 321 (1990). The circuit court has broad discretion in determining what is “a reasonable time before trial.” Carlisle, 200 Ill. App. 3d at 913, 558 N.E.2d at 321. In the present case, we do not believe that the circuit court abused its discretion in ruling that the Diocese did not file its motion within a reasonable time before the trial.\nWisniewski filed his complaint on October 24, 2002, and from the very beginning, he alleged that he suffered “severe and permanent injuries or diseases to his psychological and psychiatric health.” In February of 2008, the jury trial was scheduled to begin in August of 2008. The Diocese did not file the motion requesting a Rule 215 mental examination until June 24, 2008.\nThe circuit court conducted a hearing on the Diocese’s motion on June 25, 2008. At the hearing, the circuit court noted that the motion was filed 50 days from the trial date, and the court indicated that it did not intend to continue the trial date because of the motion. At the hearing, the court gave the Diocese until June 27, 2008, to provide the court with information concerning how long its expert needed to conduct the examination, when the examination would take place, when the expert would be able to give his written report, and when he would be available for a deposition. The Diocese, however, did not provide the trial court with any information until June 30, 2008, when the circuit court received a proposed outline of the mental examination, which was prepared by Dr. Shopper and which indicated that he wanted to conduct three two-hour sessions with Wisniewski in order to conduct his examination. The Diocese did not provide the other information the circuit court requested, including when the expert was available to conduct his examination, when he would have his report prepared, and when he would be available for a deposition.\nOn July 3, 2008, the circuit court denied the Diocese’s motion for the mental examination. The court noted that there were only 46 days before the beginning of the jury trial and that the Diocese had not furnished the ordered information. On July 15, 2008, the Diocese filed a motion to reconsider the denial of its request for a mental examination. The trial court held a hearing on the motion to reconsider on July 21, 2008, four weeks prior to the trial, and denied the Diocese’s motion to reconsider. The court stated at the hearing that the Diocese still had not furnished the information the court had requested. The court stated, “You can’t expect a trial judge, forty[-]some days before trial, to grant [a mental examination] unless the trial judge knows *** when would the exam go forward, when would the written report be completed, and when would *** [the expert] be available for [the deposition].” The court noted that the jury trial was scheduled to begin in four weeks and that it could not grant the Diocese’s motion without having the information it requested.\nIn Ford v. Herman, 316 Ill. App. 3d 726, 736, 737 N.E.2d 332, 341 (2000), the court affirmed a circuit court’s denial of a Rule 215 motion for a medical examination when the motion was filed 68 days before the scheduled trial date. The court stated: “No dates were proposed for examinations and subsequent depositions. So the trial court could not know when those events would be completed.” Ford, 316 Ill. App. 3d at 736, 737 N.E.2d at 341. In the present case, for whatever reason, the Diocese chose not to provide the circuit court with the information it requested concerning when key events relevant to the examination would be completed. Under these circumstances, we will not find that the circuit court abused its discretion.\nIV\nEvidentiary Rulings\nThe Diocese’s final argument is that the circuit court abused its discretion in striking certain references from Kopacz’s notes dated August 30, 2002, that he created after a therapy session with Wisniewski. In addition, the Diocese argues that the circuit court abused its discretion in limiting its cross-examination of two of Wisniewski’s witnesses concerning the August 30, 2002, notes.\nThe admission of evidence and the scope of cross-examination are issues within the sound discretion of a trial court, and a reviewing court will not reverse rulings on those issues absent an abuse of discretion. Snelson v. Kamm, 204 Ill. 2d 1, 33, 787 N.E.2d 796, 814 (2003); Leonardi v. Loyola University of Chicago, 168 Ill. 2d 83, 102, 658 N.E.2d 450, 459 (1995). In addition, an error in evidentiary rulings does not warrant a reversal unless the error was substantially prejudicial and affected the outcome of the trial. Simmons v. Garces, 198 Ill. 2d 541, 566-67, 763 N.E.2d 720, 736 (2002).\nIn the present case, on August 30, 2002, prior to Wisniewski filing his lawsuit in the present case, Kopacz had a therapy session with Wisniewski and prepared some notes concerning the therapy session. The notes referenced Wisniewski talking to Kopacz about his case against the Diocese. Wisniewski told Kopacz that his lawyer had sent a letter to the Diocese requesting a response, and he told Kopacz that he was not sure whether a court case would be viable.\nAt the trial, the Diocese attempted to first introduce this evidence during its cross-examination of Wisniewski’s expert witness, Dr. Peterson. Peterson testified that a part of his investigation included reviewing Kopacz’s notes. During its cross-examination of Peterson, the Diocese asked Peterson the following: “In the August 30th, ‘02 notes of Dr. Kopacz, Dr. Kopacz’s notes, quote, Not sure whether a court case would be viable or not, close quote, correct?” Wisniewski’s attorney objected to this questioning, stating that it related to settlement negotiations that occurred in August of 2002. The circuit court sustained Wisniewski’s objection but stated: “Clearly, you can’t bring it up in front of a jury. I’ll allow you to make an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury. But for right now, we’re going to have to skip over it.” The Diocese argued to the circuit court that the questioning did not involve settlement negotiations, and the court responded, “We’ll go over it outside the presence of the jury, and after I hear what I hear, I’ll let you know how I rule, but for right now, let’s skip over it and go on.” Later, during cross-examination of Peterson, the Diocese again asked Peterson about Kopacz’s August 30, 2002, notes, asking whether the notes indicated that Wisniewski was not sure whether a court case would be viable. The court again sustained Wisniewski’s objection to this testimony, stating that it had already directed the parties not to address this aspect of the notes because it referenced settlement discussions.\nWisniewski introduced Kopacz’s testimony by way of an evidence deposition. Prior to the presentation of the deposition testimony, the circuit court struck a portion of the cross-examination of Kopacz that referred to the communication Wisniewski had with Kopacz on August 30, 2002, about the viability of the lawsuit. In striking the testimony, the court stated that the questioning improperly referred to settlement negotiations and that the questioning also involved an irrelevant legal opinion on the statute of limitations issue.\nOn appeal, the Diocese argues that the circuit court abused its discretion in preventing it from introducing evidence that on August 30, 2002, Wisniewski expressed concern during therapy with Kopacz about the viability of a lawsuit. We agree with the circuit court that Wisniewski’s expression of concern about the viability of his case against the Diocese was irrelevant and immaterial to the issues before the jury. Evidence is relevant if it has “ ‘any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.’ ” DiCosola v. Bowman, 342 Ill. App. 3d 530, 535, 794 N.E.2d 875, 879 (2003) (quoting Wojcik v. City of Chicago, 299 Ill. App. 3d 964, 971, 702 N.E.2d 303, 309 (1998)). The fact that a person untrained in the practice of law expresses concern over the viability of his or her legal claim is hardly remarkable and is of no consequence to any issue of material fact. Furthermore, the Diocese has not made a convincing case that the jury’s verdict would have been different had this testimony been admitted. Accordingly, the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court of St. Clair County.\nAffirmed.\nT&#39;he record on appeal does not explain what type of facility the Hincke House is but indicates that the Diocese temporarily housed Kownacki at the Hincke House for treatment.\nIn 2002, the Bishops of the United States adopted a nationwide policy for dealing with child sexual abuse and misconduct by priests, and that policy was adopted by the Diocese in July of 2003. This new policy replaced the 1993 policy.\nJudge Ripple wrote separately, concurring in part and dissenting in part, but the concurring portions of his opinion are the majority holdings on the issues addressed therein.\nSection 13 — 202.2(b) was amended on January 1, 2011, to change 5 years to 20 years. Pub. Act 96 — 1093, §5, eff. Jan. 1, 2011.&quot;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}, {&#39;author&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE SPOMER,&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE SPOMER,\ndissenting:\nI respectfully dissent. In so doing, I recognize that the equities in this case overwhelmingly favor the plaintiff and that the defendant’s conduct was egregious and contributed to the harm that the plaintiff has suffered. However, my review of Illinois law as it applies to the facts of this case compels a conclusion that the plaintiffs claims were time-barred in 1991 when the plaintiff reached the age of 30. At that time, the statute of repose applicable to childhood sexual abuse cases was “12 years after the date on which the person abused attains the age of 18 years.” Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 110, par. 13 — 202.2(b). As the Illinois Supreme Court has made clear, this statute of repose applies to claims arising from alleged misconduct of the Diocese to the same extent that it applies to the claims against the priest who perpetrated the abuse. Doe A. v. Diocese of Dallas, 234 Ill. 2d 393, 412-13 (2009). In addition, the due process clause of the Illinois Constitution prohibits claims that were once time-barred from being revived through the subsequent legislative action of the Illinois General Assembly that has since repealed the statute of repose. Doe A., 234 Ill. 2d at 411-12.\nRealizing this and in an attempt to toll the statute of repose, the plaintiff has raised the doctrines of fraudulent concealment, equitable tolling, and equitable estoppel. All three of these defenses to the statute of repose require that acts on the part of the defendant, or omissions, in the case of fraudulent concealment where a fiduciary or special relationship is shown, prevent the plaintiff from discovering his cause of action. See Clay v. Kuhl, 189 Ill. 2d 603, 613-14 (2000) (reciting the elements of fraudulent concealment and equitable tolling); see also Orlak v. Loyola University Health System, 228 Ill. 2d 1, 22 (2007) (equitable estoppel requires that the defendant’s conduct or representations cause the plaintiff to delay filing suit). Whether or not the plaintiff can be said to have had a special relationship with the Diocese, I believe that Illinois law in effect at the time that the statute of repose expired prohibited a finding that acts or omissions by the Diocese prevented the plaintiff from discovering his claim. As further discussed below, Illinois law presumed an injury at the time the sexual abuse occurred, and, under Illinois law, the plaintiff had sufficient knowledge to investigate and prosecute potential claims against the defendant prior to the expiration of the statute of repose in 1991.\nFirst, prior to the Illinois General Assembly’s recent amendment to the statute of limitations, which provides that “[k]nowledge of the [childhood sexual] abuse does not constitute discovery of the injury or the causal relationship between any later-discovered injury and the abuse” (735 ILCS 5/13 — 202.2(b) (West 2008)), the law in Illinois was quite the opposite. As recognized by the Illinois Supreme Court in Clay, prior to the aforementioned enactment, Illinois law presumed “an intent to harm and a resulting injury” from sexual abuse. (Emphasis added.) Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 611. As in Clay, the plaintiff in the case at bar testified that he did not repress his memories of the sexual abuse. Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 613. He always remembered that he was abused, that the abuse was harmful, that Kownacki was his abuser, and that Kownacki was a representative of the Diocese. Because Illinois law presumed some injury from childhood sexual abuse at the time of the occurrence, the misconduct of the Diocese in concealing its knowledge of Kownacki’s abuse of other children, before, after, and including the plaintiff, could not have prevented the plaintiff from discovering that he was injured. The plaintiff might not have known the extent of his injuries at that time, but Illinois law presumed immediate injury from the act of the sexual abuse itself, and the plaintiff does not deny knowledge of the abuse. See Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 613.\nSecond, although the plaintiff might not have had actual knowledge regarding the role the Diocese played in knowingly allowing Kownacki to be involved with children in the various parishes, he knew that Kownacki was a representative of the Diocese. Thus, he had sufficient knowledge of the possibility of negligence on the part of the Diocese to at least investigate its role. However, the plaintiff, at no time prior to 1991, undertook to investigate the role of the Diocese in Kownacki’s sexual abuse of him. Had the plaintiff undertaken an investigation and inquired of the Diocese, by means of discovery or otherwise, as to its role, he might have uncovered the facts that give rise to his current causes of action. Having not done so, he cannot now establish that acts or omissions on the part of the Diocese prevented him from discovering the nature of the Diocese’s misconduct prior to 1991.\nBecause the plaintiff cannot establish that the Diocese prevented him from discovering his causes of action prior to 1991, the plaintiffs causes of action were time-barred at that time under the then-applicable statute of repose and cannot be revived without running afoul of the due process clause of the Illinois Constitution. See Doe A., 234 Ill. 2d at 411-12. For these reasons, I must conclude that the circuit court erred when it denied the defendant’s motion for a summary judgment, when it denied the defendant’s motion for a directed verdict, and when it denied the defendant’s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;dissent&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

Baniassadi filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to section 2—619(a)(5) of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure (Code) (735 ILCS 5/2—619(a)(5) (West 2008)) on the grounds that the complaint was time barred under section 13—214.3 of the Code (735 ILCS 5/13—214.3(b), (c) (West 2008)). The circuit court granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice and denied Baniassadi’s request for attorney fees and sanctions. On appeal, Kheirkhahvash contends that the circuit court erred in dismissing the complaint as time barred where a factual dispute exists as to when Kheirkhahvash discovered Baniassadi’s negligence, the negligence alleged was continuous and Kheirkhahvash incurred increasingly severe injuries, and a language barrier prevented the timely discovery of the injury and damages. Kheirkhahvash further contends that Baniassadi’s acts of fraudulent concealment bar him from raising a statute of limitations defense. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.\nBACKGROUND\nKheirkhahvash was born in Iran. She came to the United States on a visitor’s visa on August 3, 1999. Her visa was set to expire in February 2000. Kheirkhahvash was fluent in Farsi and could not read, speak or write English. She retained Baniassadi, whose first language is also Farsi, in January or February of 2000. Baniassadi obtained an extension of her visitor’s visa to July 2000. Kheirkhahvash also sought Baniassadi’s advice on the issue of remaining in the United States permanently. According to Kheirkhahvash, she told him that she had come to the United States because she was afraid of her abusive husband and that she also wanted Baniassadi’s help in obtaining a divorce. Baniassadi told her that fear of her husband was not a sufficient reason for her to obtain asylum and that she should seek asylum on political grounds, based on a fear of persecution by the Iranian government. He asked about her political involvement and she told him she had never been involved in politics. He told her he would prepare a statement that he had used successfully with other clients.\nBaniassadi prepared an asylum application that contained Kheirkhahvash’s personal information. In the section of the application that asked for the information regarding the nature of the asylum claim, he included a reference to an attached exhibit. Kheirkhahvash signed the application itself (without the exhibit) on February 16, 2000. In June 2000, she signed two more documents, an attorney appearance form and another document containing biographical information.\nOn August 1, 2000, Baniassadi filed Kheirkhahvash’s asylum application. A verified personal statement was attached to the application. According to the statement, Kheirkhahvash became a supporter of Mojahedin Khaleq1 (MEK) when she was in high school. It stated that she was put on probation by her school’s Islamic committee and told that if she did not stop her anti-Islamic activities, she would be expelled from school and reported to the revolutionary guards. The statement claimed that although Kheirkhahvash passed her university entrance exam, she was put on probation for two years and ordered to support the Islamic regime, comply with Islamic dress code and attend her local mosque. When she was finally admitted to the university, she was put on probation for refusing to attend the mosque and voicing opposition to the regime. The university then reported her to the revolutionary guards. According to the statement, she and her father were both detained by the revolutionary guards and were interrogated and tortured. She married a man who allegedly was also a supporter of MEK and worked as a journalist for a magazine that was shut down by the regime. He was also interrogated and tortured by the revolutionary guards. The statement concluded by stating that Kheirkhahvash was detained and tortured a second time and upon her release, she went into hiding and was able to get out of Iran and come to the United States.\n1The record and briefs contain many spelling variations for the name of this organization, e.g., Mujahedin-e Khalq, Muhajadeen-el-Kalq, Mujahedeene-Khalq, etc.\nThe statement was signed, but Kheirkhahvash maintains that the signature on the statement is not hers and points out that it does not match other documents containing her actual signature. She also maintains that she did not see the statement until Baniassadi sent her a version of the statement that had been translated into Farsi in late August/early September, after her application had already been filed. He told her she needed to memorize the statement for her upcoming interview with immigration officials. Kheirkhahvash told him that the statement was false, she knew nothing about the MEK, her husband had never been a journalist and was not a supporter of MEK, and she could not testify to such facts. Baniassadi told her that because the application had already been filed, she had no choice but to testify to those facts or she would be denied asylum and would be deported to Iran for filing a false application.\nAt the immigration interview, Kheirkhahvash testified through a translator to the facts in the verified personal statement. At the conclusion of the interview, Baniassadi told her that her application would be approved and that she would get her green card. In fact, the asylum application was denied and she was served with a notice to appear in immigration court for a removal hearing. When she asked Baniassadi to explain the meaning of the notice, he told her that her application had been referred to an immigration judge and it would be reconsidered and granted. He again told her that his other Iranian clients had claimed persecution on account of their sympathies for the MEK and were granted asylum. He warned her that if she tried to withdraw her personal statement, the immigration judge would order that she be deported to Iran.\nKheirkhahvash said that before her removal hearing, Baniassadi told her that her father had to testify to the facts in the personal statement. When Kheirkhahvash showed the statement to her father, he became very angry with her. He refused to testify and tried to get Baniassadi to withdraw the asylum application. He said that he did not want to lie, that nobody in Iran supports the MEK, and that he did not want to get involved in anything to do with the MEK. Her father eventually agreed to testify after Baniassadi persuaded him that if he did not testify, his daughter would be deported to Iran.\nOn April 15, 2002, a hearing was held before an immigration judge and Kheirkhahvash’s father testified to the facts in the personal state ment. The government attorney introduced evidence that the MEK was listed as a terrorist organization by the Attorney General of the United States. Kheirkhahvash maintains that her father’s testimony was inconsistent, and that Baniassadi requested a continuance because he realized he needed additional evidence. He prepared an additional affidavit for her mother to sign that described in detail how Kheirkhahvash was beaten and tortured because of her support for the MEK. On April 24, 2002, Kheirkhahvash testified according to the facts in the verified personal statement. The immigration judge denied her asylum application and her withholding of removal request, finding that she was a member of a terrorist organization and that she posed a danger to the security of the United States. The judge ordered that she be deported to Iran.\nOn May 24, 2002, Baniassadi filed a motion to reconsider. The motion was denied on July 12, 2002, and Baniassadi filed an appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals on August 12, 2002. On October 10, 2002, Kheirkhahvash was taken into custody by the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She was released from detention under an order of supervision dated February 4, 2003. On October 8, 2003, the Board of Immigration Appeals entered an order affirming the denial of Kheirkhahvash’s asylum application and withholding of removal on the basis of her admitted affiliation with MEK. However, the order returned the case to the immigration judge for consideration of Kheirkhahvash’s claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture.\nSometime after her release from custody, Kheirkhahvash consulted with and subsequently retained new counsel. The record contains a consent to attorney withdrawal dated November 24, 2003, withdrawing the appearance of Baniassadi as Kheirkhahvash’s attorney. It also contains a consent to substitution of counsel dated November 25, 2003, authorizing the appearance of her current attorney. Both documents are stamped as being received in court on December 3, 2003. In a letter dated November 24, 2003, and file stamped November 25, 2003, Kheirkhahvash requested the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission (ARDC) to investigate Baniassadi for advis ing her to file and testify falsely with regard to her asylum application. On July 14, 2004, Kheirkhahvash’s current attorney filed a motion to withdraw her original asylum application, contending that it was the product of ineffective assistance of counsel. On August 21, 2009, Kheirkhahvash filed a complaint against Baniassadi alleging legal malpractice and fraud. Baniassadi filed a motion to dismiss the complaint as untimely and the trial court granted the motion on December 18, 2009. This appeal follows.\nANALYSIS\nA motion for involuntary dismissal under section 2—619 admits the legal sufficiency of the complaint but asserts an affirmative defense or other matter that avoids or defeats the claim. DeLuna v. Burciaga, 223 Ill. 2d 49, 59 (2006). “The purpose of a section 2—619 motion is to dispose of issues of law and easily proved issues of fact early in the litigation.” Czarobski v. Lata, 227 Ill. 2d 364, 369 (2008). When ruling on a section 2—619 motion, a court must interpret all pleadings and supporting documents in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Porter v. Decatur Memorial Hospital, 227 Ill. 2d 343, 352 (2008). Our review of a section 2—619 motion to dismiss is de novo. Id.\ne1 Baniassadi filed his motion to dismiss pursuant to section 2—619(a)(5), which provides for involuntary dismissal on the grounds that the action was not commenced within the time limited by law. 735 ILCS 5/2—619(a)(5) (West 2008). The statute of limitations for a legal malpractice action is set forth in section 13—214.3 of the Code, which provides that an action against an attorney for damages based on tort, contract or otherwise arising out of an act or omission in the performance of professional services “must be commenced within 2 years from the time the person bringing the action knew or reasonably should have known of the injury for which damages are sought.” 735 ILCS 5/13—214.3(b) (West 2008). Section 13—214.3 also contains a statute of repose. It provides that an action for legal malpractice “may not be commenced in any event more than 6 years after the date on which the act or omission occurred.” 735 ILCS 5/13—214.3(c) (West 2008).\nIn arguing that the trial court erred in dismissing her complaint as time barred, Kheirkhahvash raises multiple issues, some of which overlap and will be discussed as a single issue. First, Kheirkhahvash contends that the trial court erred in equating her discovery in September 2000 that Baniassadi had filed a false asylum application with the date on which she knew or reasonably should have known of the injury. Kheirkhahvash argues that even if the negligent act occurred on August 1, 2000, with the filing of the false asylum applica tion, and she discovered in September 2000 that a false statement had been filed, she did not realize at that time that she had sustained an injury, nor had she incurred actual damages. Kheirkhahvash further contends that the trial court ignored allegations in the complaint that she was prevented from timely discovering her injuries because of language and cultural barriers.\nAs an initial matter, although both parties’ briefs indicate that the trial court concluded that Kheirkhahvash knew of the alleged negligence in September 2000, we note that the trial court’s order contains no date for when the statute of limitations began to run. It merely states that Kheirkhahvash’s complaint is dismissed with prejudice “as being time barred by the Statute of Limitations of 2 years in contract and 5 years in fraud.” There is nothing in the record to indicate a determination by the trial court as to the date on which Kheirkhahvash knew or reasonably should have known she had a cause of action. There is also no evidence in the record that the trial court “ignored” allegations in the complaint that language and cultural barriers prevented the timely discovery of Kheirkhahvash’s injuries.\nWe now turn to the issue of whether the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint as time barred. We agree with Kheirkhahvash that the statute of limitations did not begin to run in late August/ early September 2000 when Baniassadi faxed her a copy of the personal statement in Farsi and she told him it was false. The general rule in Illinois is that a cause of action for legal malpractice does not accrue until the entry of an adverse judgment, settlement, or dismissal of the underlying action in which the plaintiff has become entangled due to the alleged negligent advice of her attorney. Warnock v. Karm Winand &amp; Patterson, 376 Ill. App. 3d 364, 371-72 (2007). This court has noted that “[tjhere may be rare cases in which it is painfully obvious, prior to any adverse ruling against the plaintiff client, that he has been injured as a result of professional negligence.” Id. at 372. However, this is not such a case. Kheirkhahvash did not speak English or understand the immigration process and relied upon the advice of her attorney. It would not have been obvious to her at that point in time that she would be deported on the basis of the false asylum application. In fact, Baniassadi assured Kheirkhahvash that he had successfully obtained political asylum for other clients on those grounds and that she would be deported if she did not go along with the story. Thus, the earliest date at which the statute of limitations could have started to run is April 24, 2002, the date the immigration judge entered an order finding Kheirkhahvash to be a member of a terrorist organization and ordering her deportation to Iran.\nMoreover, we agree with Kheirkhahvash that due to language and cultural barriers, it is unlikely that she knew or reasonably should have known even at that time that she had a cause of action against Baniassadi, who continued to reassure her that he would appeal the decision and the order would be reversed. However, once Kheirkhahvash obtained new counsel, it can no longer be argued that she should not reasonably have known that she had a cause of action against Baniassadi. Her new counsel obviously knew about the false asylum application and the effect it had on her client, as evidenced by the filing of an ARDC complaint against Baniassadi on those grounds on November 25, 2003. Thus, the very latest date that the statute of limitations could have started to run is November 25, 2003, which means that, barring any applicable exception, her cause of action expired on November 25, 2005, and the trial court correctly dismissed the complaint.\nNext, Kheirkhahvash argues that the court erred in applying the statute of limitations as a bar to this action because the negligence perpetrated by Baniassadi was continuous and Kheirkhahvash incurred increasingly severe injuries. She contends that her complaint was timely filed because Baniassadi committed continuous acts of negligence until December 3, 2003, when he withdrew as Kheirkhahvash’s counsel, at which time the wrongful acts ceased. Thus, because her complaint was filed on August 21, 2009, Kheirkhahvash maintains that it was within the six-year statute of repose and was therefore timely filed.\nWe need not address the issue of whether Baniassadi’s negligence was continuous because this argument has no merit on its face. Even if we were to agree that the statute of repose did not start running until Baniassadi’s withdrawal, the complaint would not have been timely filed under the statute of limitations. A statute of limitations and a statute of repose are not interchangeable. A statute of limitations governs the time within which lawsuits may be filed after a cause of action has accrued, while a statute of repose extinguishes the action itself after a set period of time, regardless of when the action accrued. Ferguson v. McKenzie, 202 Ill. 2d 304, 311 (2001). In Ferguson, our supreme court stated:\n“Unlike a statute of limitations, which begins running upon accrual of a cause of action, a statute of repose begins running when a specific event occurs, regardless of whether an action has accrued or whether an injury has resulted. [Citation.]\nA statute of repose gives effect to a policy different from that advanced by a statute of limitations; it is intended to terminate the possibility of liability after a defined period of time, regardless of a potential plaintiff’s lack of knowledge of his or her cause of action.” Id.\nOnce Baniassadi withdrew as counsel, Kheirkhahvash knew or reasonably should have known that she had a cause of action. A deportation order had been entered on April 24, 2002, so she already knew of her injury. Once she obtained new counsel, it is clear that she knew her injury had been wrongfully caused because she filed an ARDC complaint. Although the attorney consent for withdrawal was received in court December 3, 2003, the document stated that it was effective November 24, 2003, one day prior to the filing of her ARDC complaint against Baniassadi on November 25. Therefore, she knew at that time that she had a cause of action and the statute of limitations began to run. Whether the statute of repose began to run the same day her action accrued or three years earlier is irrelevant. The statute of repose could not operate as a statute of limitations and give her six years instead of two in which to file her action. Under the statute of limitations, her cause of action expired at the latest on November 25, 2005.\nThird, Kheirkhahvash argues that the trial court erred in concluding as a matter of law that her claim was time barred when a factual dispute existed as to when she discovered Baniassadi’s negligence. We note that Kheirkhahvash does not state anywhere in her brief when she believes she discovered Baniassadi’s negligence. She obviously knew she had a cause of action when she filed her complaint on August 21, 2009. Yet she does not point to anything that happened within the two years prior to that date that caused her to suddenly discover Baniassadi’s negligence. She claims that the statute of repose began to run when Baniassadi withdrew as counsel and his wrongful acts ceased. But she also claims that she did not discover that she had a cause of action when she retained her current counsel in November 2003, because Baniassadi did not admit to her current counsel that he had been grossly negligent in his representation. This argument is without merit. It suggests that the only way Kheirkhahvash’s current counsel could have learned of the negligence was through Baniassadi himself.\nIn fact, Kheirkhahvash filed an ARDC complaint on November 25, 2003, in which she requested an investigation of Baniassadi for advising her to file and testify falsely with regard to her asylum application. Her current counsel most certainly knew or should have known at that time that she had a cause of action. Therefore, at the very latest, the statute of limitations began to run on November 25, 2003. While the time when an injured party knew or reasonably should have known of the injury and that it was wrongfully caused is usually a disputed question to be resolved by the finder of fact, if it is apparent from the undisputed facts that only one conclusion can be drawn, the question becomes one for the court. Witherell v. Weimer, 85 Ill. 2d 146, 156 (1981). There is nothing in the record to indicate that there is any possibility that Kheirkhahvash did not know of the negligence at the time she filed the ARDC complaint. Thus, the trial court did not err in determining as a matter of law that her complaint was time barred.\nFinally, Kheirkhahvash contends that under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, Baniassadi is prevented from raising a statute of limitations defense because he engaged in acts of fraudulent concealment. These are actually two separate arguments: (1) that fraudulent concealment by Baniassadi operates as an exception to both the statute of limitations and the statute of repose, and (2) that Baniassadi is equitably estopped from raising a statute of limitations defense.\nWe first address the fraudulent concealment argument. Section 13—215 of the Code provides that if a person liable to an action fraudulently conceals the cause of such action from the knowledge of the person entitled thereto, the action may be commenced at any time within five years after the person discovers that he or she has a cause of action. 735 ILCS 5/13—215 (West 2008). Our supreme court has held that in addition to operating as an exception to the statute of limitations, section 13—215, when applicable, is an exception to the statute of repose in legal malpractice actions. DeLuna, 223 Ill. 2d at 74.\n“As a general matter, one alleging fraudulent concealment must ‘show affirmative acts by the fiduciary designed to prevent the discovery of the action.’ ” Clay v. Kuhl, 189 Ill. 2d 603, 613 (2000) (quoting Hagney v. Lopeman, 147 Ill. 2d 458, 463 (1992)). However, there is a widely recognized exception to this rule in cases where the existence of a fiduciary relationship is clearly established. DeLuna, 223 Ill. 2d at 76 (citing Crowell v. Bilandic, 81 Ill. 2d 422, 428 (1980)). “[A] fiduciary who is silent, and thus fails to fulfill his duty to disclose material facts concerning the existence of a cause of action, has fraudulently concealed that action, even without affirmative acts or representations.” (Emphasis omitted.) Id. at 77. Our supreme court has also recognized that an attorney-client relationship constitutes a fiduciary relationship. Id. (and cases cited therein).\nAlthough it is not necessary to show affirmative acts where a fiduciary relationship has been clearly established, our supreme court has insisted on strict pleading requirements for a plaintiff alleging fraudulent concealment. Hagney v. Lopeman, 147 Ill. 2d 458, 463-64 (1992). Specifically, “to excuse diligence in discovering the fraud, the plaintiff must attribute the failure to discover to the trust and confidence placed in the fiduciary.” Id. at 464. “In order to state a claim for fraudulent concealment, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant concealed a material fact when he was under a duty to disclose that fact to plaintiff.” Connick v. Suzuki Motor Co., 174 Ill. 2d 482, 500 (1996).\nIn DeLuna, the plaintiffs alleged that their attorney failed to reveal pertinent facts, misled them by telling them their case was going well when it had, in fact, been dismissed, and failed to disclose material facts bearing on the procedural status of the case. DeLuna, 223 Ill. 2d at 79-80. Moreover, the plaintiffs alleged that they could not speak English and that they relied in good faith on their attorney’s reassurances. Id. at 80-81. The supreme court held that these allegations were sufficient to meet the pleading requirements for fraudulent concealment. Id. at 81.\nHere, it is doubtful that Kheirkhahvash’s complaint meets the pleading requirements. The complaint does not contain any reference to fraudulent concealment. In her fraud count, Kheirkhahvash focuses on Baniassadi’s intentional, knowing, and willful conduct in filing a false application rather than on his representations and assurances to her and her trust in those assurances. Moreover, even if we were to determine that Kheirkhahvash’s complaint meets the pleading requirements for fraudulent concealment, it cannot save her legal malpractice action. As noted above, section 13—215 operates as an exception to both the statute of limitations and the statute of repose. Thus, if the statute of repose had already run and Kheirkhahvash successfully pled fraudulent concealment, section 13—215 would give her an additional five years from the time she discovered that she had a cause of action in which to file her complaint. However, it is well settled in Illinois law that if a reasonable amount of time remains in the applicable limitations period when the plaintiff discovers the cause of action, section 13—215 will not extend that period. See, e.g., Leffler v. Engler, Zoghlin &amp; Mann, Ltd., 157 Ill. App. 3d 718, 721 (1987); Barratt v. Goldberg, 296 Ill. App. 3d 252, 258 (1998) (and cases cited therein).\nBaniassadi filed the false asylum application on August 1, 2000. Thus, under the statute of repose, Kheirkhahvash’s cause of action would extinguish on August 1, 2006. At the very latest, she knew she had a cause of action at the time she retained new counsel and filed a complaint against Baniassadi with the ARDC on November 25, 2003. At that time, almost three years remained under the statute of repose. Moreover, under Kheirkhahvash’s argument that the statute of repose did not start to run until Baniassadi withdrew, there would have been six years remaining under the statute of repose. Thus, under both possible dates, a reasonable amount of time remained such that even if Kheirkhahvash successfully pled fraudulent concealment, it would operate only as a possible exception to the statute of limitations and not as an exception to the statute of repose.\nSimilarly, fraudulent concealment does not save her malpractice action as an exception to the statute of limitations. Assuming, arguendo, that Kheirkhahvash’s cause of action accrued on April 24, 2002, when the deportation order was entered, her cause of action would have expired on April 24, 2004. She could then argue that when she discovered the fraudulent concealment on November 25, 2003, the amount of time remaining under the statute of limitations was not reasonable. However, even if her complaint sufficiently pled fraudulent concealment and section 13—215 operated as an exception to the statute of limitations, she would only have had five years from the time she learned of the cause of action, which would have given her until November 25, 2008. She did not file her complaint until August 21, 2009. Therefore, her complaint was untimely under section 13—215.\nWe similarly reject Kheirkhahvash’s equitable estoppel argument. In order for a plaintiff to invoke estoppel against a statute of limitations defense, “the plaintiff must have relied on acts or representations of the defendant which caused the plaintiff to refrain from filing suit within the applicable statute of limitations.” Leffler, 157 Ill. App. 3d at 722-23. However, “[t]he doctrine of equitable estoppel will not apply to a case if defendant’s conduct terminated within ample time to allow the plaintiff an opportunity to file a cause of action within the limitation period.” Barratt, 296 Ill. App. 3d at 259. Baniassadi’s conduct terminated on November 24, 2003. This is roughly the same time that Kheirkhahvash filed an ARDC complaint against Baniassadi, evidence that she knew or reasonably should have known that her injury was wrongfully caused. She then had two years under the statute of limitations for legal malpractice actions to file her claim and therefore, the doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply.\nAs a final matter, we address defendant’s request for sanctions under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 375 (eff. Feb. 1, 1994). Rule 375(b) provides that if a reviewing court determines that an appeal is frivolous, or that it was not taken in good faith or for an improper purpose, an appropriate sanction may be imposed upon the party or the attorney of the party. Ill. S. Ct. R. 375(b) (eff. Feb. 1, 1994). However, as defendant also correctly notes, the imposition of sanctions is a matter left strictly to the appellate court’s discretion. Residential Carpentry, Inc. v. Illinois Workers’ Compensation Comm’n, 389 Ill. App. 3d 975, 976 (2009). We agree that there is little or no merit to this appeal but in the exercise of our discretion, we decline to impose sanctions.\nCONCLUSION\n•2 Based on the foregoing analysis, we hold that the trial court did not err in determining as a matter of law that Kheirkhahvash’s complaint was time barred. Under the most generous interpretation of the facts, the latest date at which she knew or reasonably should have known of her injury and that it was wrongfully caused is November 25, 2003. Thus, under the statute of limitations for legal malpractice actions, her cause of action expired on November 25, 2005. We further conclude that her claim that her complaint was timely filed under the six-year statute of repose because defendant’s continuous negligent actions did not cease until he withdrew as counsel on November 24, 2003, is without merit. A statute of repose does not operate as a statute of limitations and give a plaintiff six years in which to file instead of two after a cause of action accrues. Finally, even if we were to determine that her complaint met the pleading requirements for fraudulent concealment and tolled the statute of limitations, her cause of action would have expired on November 25, 2008. Moreover, equitable estoppel does not apply because defendant’s conduct terminated at the time her cause of action accrued, allowing ample time to file her complaint within the two-year statute of limitations.\nAffirmed.\nBotTa the complaint and appellant’s brief state that Kheirkhahvash was detained on October 10, 2003, and released February 24, 2004, under an order of supervision. Documents filed by the appellee state that Kheirkhahvash was detained on October 10, 2002, and was released February 4, 2003. The only official document in the record relating to the detention is an order of supervision dated February 4, 2003. Thus, because Kheirkhahvash was released from custody in February 2003, we conclude she was in fact detained in October 2002.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

On appeal, petitioner contends that this court should reverse the Board’s dismissal of his petition and remand for further proceedings because he demonstrated justifiable grounds for further proceedings before the Board. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\nBACKGROUND\nOn January 11, 2010, petitioner filed a complaint with the Board in which he alleged, inter alia, that respondents violated section 9—11 of the Election Code (10 ILCS 5/9—11 (West 2002)) by falsely reporting the identity of the parties that loaned the Group $390,000 in 2002 and reporting a false recipient for an expenditure of $100,080 that was made by the Group on June 28, 2002. Petitioner also alleged that respondents violated section 9—25 of the Election Code (10 ILCS 5/9—25 (West 2002)) by receiving contributions made in the name of another person, in that $390,000 in loans was received by the Group in 2002 from “Dodge of Midlothian” and “Sales, Inc.,” businesses owned by Gerald and Elizabeth Gorman, and its reports were then amended in 2004 to reflect that Gerald Gorman made those loans. Petitioner further alleged that respondents violated sections 9—8.10(a)(3) and 9—8.10(a)(4) of the Election Code (10 ILCS 5/9—8.10(a)(3), (a)(4) (West 2006)) by making expenditures to Gerald Gorman to reimburse him for mortgage payments he had made on a personal residence and violated section 9—8.10(a)(11) of the Election Code (10 ILCS 5/9—8.10(a)(11) (West 2002)) by making multiple expenditures to Gerald Gorman for services that he had not actually rendered.\nA closed preliminary hearing was conducted on February 3, 2010, by a hearing examiner for the Board, and on February 7, 2010, the hearing examiner filed a written report in which he summarized the proceedings and made conclusions and recommendations. The examiner’s report reflects that petitioner presented a summary of a semiannual report for the period of January 1 through June 30, 2002, that was believed to have been filed by the Group with the Board on July 31, 2002, and a summary of a semiannual report for the period of January 16 through June 30, 2002, that was believed to have been filed by the Group with the Board on March 9, 2004. Petitioner also presented summaries of the semiannual reports for the periods of January 1 through June 30, 2005, and January 1, 2006, through June 30, 2009. Each of the summaries contained receipts, expenditures, debts, obligations, and a funds balance of the Group for that reporting period. In addition, petitioner presented the dockets of two complaints for mortgage foreclosure by First Suburban National Bank (FSNB) against various parties, including Elizabeth Gorman and her husband Gerald.\nPetitioner asserted that the evidence showed that the Group originally reported that Dodge of Midlothian and Sales, Inc., made loans to the Group in 2002, but later amended the report to reflect that the loans were made by Gerald Gorman, and that the Group originally reported that it made a payment of $100,080 to Sales, Inc., in 2002, but later amended the report to reflect that the payment was made to Gerald Gorman. Petitioner argued that the evidence thus showed that the 2002 payment was made to Gerald Gorman and that the Group falsely reported that it was made to Sales, Inc. Petitioner also asserted that the evidence showed that the Group made numerous expenditures to Gerald Gorman from March 2006 through March 2009 as repayment for loans that he never actually made to the Group and that three payments made to Gerald Gorman in 2007 for the stated purpose of “Partial Repayment of Loan for FSNB” were used to reimburse mortgage payments on property owned by Gerald and Elizabeth Gorman in relation to mortgage foreclosure proceedings filed against them by FSNB.\nPeg Walsh, a representative of the Group, testified for respondents that it was her understanding that the Group initially reported that the loans at issue were made by Dodge of Midlothian and Sales, Inc., because the Group’s accountants advised that it do so and that Gerald Gorman was advised to amend the reports because it would have been more proper to show that the loans were coming from him, since he was the owner of those two companies and they “were used as collateral on the loans.” Brent Woods, a former treasurer of the Group, amended the reports to show that the $100,080 payment was made to Gerald Gorman, and not Sales, Inc., according to the instructions he had received from the Board. In addition, Gerald Gorman had a personal account at FSNB, and that bank was referenced by the Group in the purpose statements of three 2007 expenditures for loan repayments in its semiannual report to the Board to indicate into which bank those payments had been deposited.\nElizabeth Gorman testified that Gerald Gorman owned at least 90% of both Dodge of Midlothian and Sales, Inc., and that the reports were changed to reflect more accurately that the loans were made by Gerald. Elizabeth further testified that Woods had many conversations with the Board on how to amend correctly the reports to reflect that the $100,080 payment was made to Gerald and that the reports accurately reflected that all loan payments were made to Gerald because he was the person responsible for making all the loans at issue, regardless of who was originally listed.\nThe hearing examiner recommended that petitioner’s complaint be found not to have been filed upon justifiable grounds and that the matter not proceed to a public hearing. In doing so, the examiner concluded that regardless of whether Gerald Gorman provided the Group the loans at issue as an individual or as the owner of a business, he could have been listed as the person providing the loans because he was personally responsible for them. The examiner also concluded that any shortcomings in the report regarding the $100,080 payment to Sales, Inc., were corrected when the reports were amended. In addition, the examiner concluded that petitioner did not provide any evidence to establish that the three payments made to Gerald Gorman in 2007 for the stated purpose of “Partial Repayment of Loan for FSNB” were anything other than properly made partial loan repayments. On March 8, 2010, the Board issued a written order dismissing petitioner’s complaint, finding that it was not filed on justifiable grounds.\nPetitioner appealed from that order and this court remanded the matter to the Board for a statement of findings regarding the reasons it determined that petitioner’s complaint was not filed on justifiable grounds. Thompson v. Gorman, 405 Ill. App. 3d 979 (2010). On December 3, 2010, the Board entered an order adopting the hearing examiner’s recommendation and dismissing petitioner’s complaint on the basis that it was not filed on justifiable grounds.\nANALYSIS\nPetitioner contends on appeal that the Board erred in dismissing his complaint because he demonstrated justifiable grounds for further proceedings. Any person may file a verified complaint with the Board alleging a campaign finance violation under the Election Code. 10 ILCS 5/9—20 (West 2008). Upon receipt of the complaint, the Board is required to hold a closed preliminary hearing to determine whether the complaint appears to have been filed on justifiable grounds, and the Board shall dismiss the complaint without further hearing if it fails to determine that it had been so filed. 10 ILCS 5/9—21 (West 2008). Any party adversely affected by a judgment of the Board may obtain judicial review directly in the appellate court for the district in which the cause of action arose, and that review shall be governed by the provisions of the Administrative Review Law (735 ILCS 5/3—101 et seq. (West 2008)) and its accompanying rules. 10 ILCS 5/9—22 (West 2008).\nThe purpose of a closed preliminary hearing is to elicit evidence on whether the complaint was filed on justifiable grounds and has some basis in fact and law. 26 Ill. Adm. Code 125.252 (2010). The complainant bears the burden of introducing sufficient evidence or information for the Board to conclude that the complaint has been filed on justifiable grounds. 26 Ill. Adm. Code 125.252(c)(4) (2010). The justifiable grounds standard focuses on the factual and legal sufficiency of the complaint, and “[t]he essential inquiry is whether the complaint is factually and legally justified.” Cook County Republican Party v. Illinois State Board of Elections, 232 Ill. 2d 231, 245 (2009).\nThe determination of whether a complaint has been filed on justifiable grounds presents a mixed question of fact and law, and we therefore review the Board’s dismissal of petitioner’s complaint to determine whether the Board clearly erred in deciding that the complaint was not filed on justifiable grounds. Id. An administrative agency’s decision will be deemed clearly erroneous where the record leaves the reviewing court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. Cinkus v. Village of Stickney Municipal Officers Electoral Board, 228 Ill. 2d 200, 211 (2008).\nI. Counts I and II\nPetitioner first asserts that the Board’s decision that the first two counts of his complaint were not filed on justifiable grounds is clearly erroneous. In count I, petitioner alleged that respondents violated section 9—11 of the Election Code by falsely reporting the identity of the parties that loaned $390,000 to the Group in 2002 and/or violated section 9—25 of the Election Code by receiving $390,000 in loans made in the name of another person. In count II, petitioner alleged that respondents violated section 9—11 of the Election Code by falsely reporting the recipient of an expenditure of $100,080 made by the Group on June 28, 2002.\nEach report of campaign contributions shall disclose “each loan to or from any person within the reporting period by or to such committee in an aggregate amount or value in excess of $150, together with the full names and mailing addresses of the lender and endorsers, if any, and the date and amount of such loans.” 10 ILCS 5/9—11(8) (West 2002). In addition, “no person shall knowingly accept any anonymous contribution or contribution made by one person in the name of another person.” 10 ILCS 5/9—25 (West 2002).\nThe semiannual reports filed by the Group with the Board show that respondents initially reported on July 31, 2002, that the Group had received loans from Dodge of Midlothian of $40,000 on January 16; $50,000 on February 7; $125,000 on March 11; and $110,000 on June 28, 2002; and had received a loan of $50,000 from Sales, Inc., on February 22, 2002. The reports also show that respondents reported on March 9, 2004, that Gerald Gorman was the creditor on those loans and that $100,080 of the $110,000 loan made on June 28, 2002, had been repaid. As such, the evidence shows that the Group must have reported the incorrect identity of the lender on at least one occasion because the loans could not have been made by Dodge of Midlothian and Sales Inc., as originally reported, and also by Gerald Gorman.\nHowever, in concluding that the first count of petitioner’s complaint was not filed on justifiable grounds, the hearing examiner determined that “whether Gerald Gorman as the owner of a business or Gerald Gorman the individual gave the loans, the person who was ultimately responsible for the loan can be listed as the loaner. In this case [Elizabeth Gorman] has stated that Gerald Gorman is personally responsible for these loans.” In addition, according to the hearing examiner’s report, Elizabeth Gorman testified that Gerald Gorman owned at least 90% of both Dodge of Midlothian and Sales, Inc., that “the loaner being Dodge of Midlothian and Sales Inc., [sic] were her husband Gerald Gorman,” and that “the reports were changed to more accurately reflect Gerald Gorman.”\n“It is a well-established principle that a corporation is separate and distinct as a legal entity from its shareholders, directors and officers ***.” Main Bank of Chicago v. Baker, 86 Ill. 2d 188, 204 (1981). This is true even in a closely-held corporation in which the stock is held in a few hands. Gallagher v. Reconco Builders, Inc., 91 Ill. App. 3d 999, 1004 (1980). Thus, “[t]he law is clear that payments made by a corporation may not be attributed to individual shareholders because corporations and shareholders are distinct legal entities.” Trossman v. Philipsborn, 373 Ill. App. 3d 1020, 1048 (2007). As such, respondents could not have accurately reported that the loans at issue had been made by Gerald Gorman if they were made by Dodge of Midlothian and Sales, Inc., or vice versa, because the corporations and Gerald Gorman the individual are distinct legal entities. To the extent that the record indicates that the hearing examiner, the Board, and Elizabeth Gorman believed otherwise because Gerald Gorman owned at least 90% of both Dodge of Midlothian and Sales Inc., we disagree.\nMoreover, the evidence does not establish that Gerald Gorman made or “was ultimately responsible for” the loans at issue. Respondents initially reported that the loans were made by Dodge of Midlothian and Sales, Inc. The hearing examiner indicated in his report that he concluded that “the loans were from Gerald Gorman” because Elizabeth Gorman had testified to that effect at the preliminary hearing. However, as noted above, the testimony of Elizabeth Gorman appears to have been based on the incorrect assumption that any loans made by Dodge of Midlothian and Sales, Inc., could have been attributed to Gerald Gorman as an individual because he owned at least 90% of each corporation.\nIn addition, Peg Walsh’s testimony that it was her understanding that the reports had been amended because Dodge of Midlothian and Sales, Inc., “were used as collateral on the loans and it would be more proper to show the loans coming from Mr. Gorman,” does not establish that Gerald Gorman made the loans and raises more questions than it answers. We initially note that Walsh testified as to “her understanding of the situation,” which indicates that she did not have firsthand knowledge of the reason the reports had been amended. Moreover, Walsh did not explain how the corporations were or could have been “used as collateral on the loans.” To create a security interest by a debtor in favor of a creditor, one requirement is that the debtor must have or acquire rights in the collateral. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. American National Bank &amp; Trust Co., 288 Ill. App. 3d 760, 766 (1997). There is no evidence in the record that the Group, the debtor, had an ownership interest in either of the corporations. Moreover, if Gerald Gorman had made the loans to the Group, as respondents ultimately reported, it would not make sense for him to pledge his ownership interests in the corporations as collateral because he would have been the creditor, not the debtor.\nAs such, the implausible and oftentimes confusing explanations provided by Elizabeth Gorman and Peg Walsh regarding the reasons the reports were amended to reflect that Gerald Gorman was the lender do not shed any light as to the identity of the party or parties that made the loans at issue and actually diminish this court’s confidence that the reports are accurate. In addition, respondents did not present any other evidence, such as a written loan agreement, to show that the loans were made by Gerald Gorman. Thus, it is unclear from the record which of the reports filed by respondents are accurate as to the identity of the party or parties that made the loans at issue. We therefore determine that petitioner’s allegation, set forth in count I of his complaint, that respondents violated section 9—11 of the Election Code by falsely reporting the identity of the parties that loaned the Group $390,000 in 2002 has some basis in fact and law and appears to have been filed on justifiable grounds and conclude that the Board’s decision to the contrary is clearly erroneous.\nIn reaching that conclusion, we have considered Troy v. State Board of Elections, 84 Ill. App. 3d 740, 743-44 (1980), cited by respondents, in which this court affirmed the Board’s dismissal of the petitioner’s complaint because the evidence presented by the petitioner was insufficient to provide reasonable grounds for further inquiry, the respondent presented evidence rebutting the petitioner’s allegations, and the petitioner challenged activity that was not regulated by the Election Code. Respondents assert that the facts in this case are similar to those in Troy because in this case petitioner did not allege that they failed to fully disclose the loans made to the Group and did not produce any evidence except for the disclosure forms that had already been filed with the Board.\nThe record shows, however, that petitioner alleged in his complaint that respondents violated section 9—11 of the Election Code by falsely reporting the identity of the party or parties that made the loans at issue. In addition, the semiannual reports presented by petitioner and the unconvincing testimony provided by Elizabeth Gorman and Peg Walsh provide reasonable grounds for further inquiry to determine the identity of the party or parties which loaned the Group $390,000 in 2002.\nOn direct review of an order of an administrative agency, this court is vested with all the powers provided to the circuit court in section 3—111 of the Administrative Review Law (735 ILCS 5/3—111 (West 2008)). Ill. S. Ct. R. 335(i)(2) (eff. Feb. 1, 1994). As such, this court may affirm or reverse the Board’s decision in whole or in part (735 ILCS 5/3—111(a)(5), (a)(6) (West 2008)), and we therefore now consider whether the remaining counts in petitioner’s complaint were filed on justifiable grounds.\nTo the extent that petitioner maintains that the Board clearly erred by dismissing count II of his complaint, we disagree. In count II, petitioner alleged that respondents violated section 9—11 of the Election Code by falsely reporting the recipient of an expenditure of $100,080 made by the Group on June 28, 2002. However, section 9—11 of the Election Code (10 ILCS 5/9—11 (West 2002)) only addresses disclosure requirements for contributions received by respondents, and not the disclosure requirements regarding their expenditures and the identity of persons to whom they owe debts or obligations, which are addressed in section 9—13 (10 ILCS 5/9—13(12), (15) (West 2002)). Thus, count II of petitioner’s complaint has no basis in law, and we therefore conclude that the Board did not clearly err by dismissing that count for not being filed on justifiable grounds.\nII. Counts IV and V\nIn counts IV and V of his complaint, petitioner alleged that respondents violated sections 9—8.10(a)(3) and 9—8.10(a)(4) of the Election Code by making expenditures to Gerald Gorman to reimburse him for mortgage payments made on a personal residence. A political committee shall not make expenditures “[flor satisfaction or repayment of any debts other than loans made to the committee or to the public official or candidate on behalf of the committee or repayment of goods and services purchased by the committee under a credit agreement.” 10 ILCS 5/9—8.10(a)(3) (West 2006). In addition, a political committee shall not make expenditures “[flor the satisfaction or repayment of any debts or for the payment of any expenses relating to a personal residence.” 10 ILCS 5/9—8.10(a)(4) (West 2006).\nThe semiannual report filed by the Group with the Board for the period of July 1 through December 31, 2007, shows that the Group made three expenditures totaling $8,000 to Gerald Gorman on July 31, October 4, and November 5, 2007, and that the stated purpose for each expenditure was “Partial Repayment of Loan for FSNB.” The semiannual reports filed by the Group for the periods of January 1, 2006, through June 30, 2007, and July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2009, show that the Group made 18 expenditures totaling $37,075 to Gerald Gorman during those periods of time and that the stated purpose for each expenditure was “Partial Repayment of Loan.” The record also shows that FSNB filed two mortgage foreclosure complaints against multiple defendants, including Elizabeth and Gerald Gorman, on April 3, 2009.\nAt the closed preliminary hearing, Peg Walsh testified that Gerald Gorman had a personal account at FSNB and that the bank was included in the purpose statement for the expenditures at issue to indicate into which bank those payments had been deposited. Elizabeth Gorman testified that the expenditures were partial loan repayments made to Gerald Gorman and that FSNB was included in the purpose statements to reflect that the funds were deposited into Gerald’s personal account at that bank.\nThe hearing examiner concluded that counts IV and V of petitioner’s complaint were not filed on justifiable grounds. In doing so, he stated that Walsh and Elizabeth Gorman had testified that the expenditures at issue were partial loan repayments and determined that petitioner had not provided any evidence showing otherwise.\nWe decide, however, that petitioner presented sufficient evidence at the preliminary hearing to provide the allegations made in counts IV and V of his complaint with some basis in fact and law. The semiannual reports show that the Group reported that the expenditures at is sue were made for the purpose of “Partial Repayment of Loan for FSNB,” but also reported that all other expenditures made to Gerald Gorman from January 2006 through June 2009 were made for the purpose of “Partial Repayment of Loan.” Although Walsh and Elizabeth Gorman testified that FSNB was included in the purpose statements to signify that the expenditures at issue were to be deposited into Gerald Gorman’s personal account at FSNB, they did not explain why the purpose statements for the other expenditures made to Gerald Gorman did not also include a notation regarding the bank into which the funds had been deposited. In addition, the expenditures at issue were described as being made for FSNB, rather than to FSNB or at FSNB, which were more accurate ways to signify that the payments had been deposited in Gerald Gorman’s personal account at that bank.\nAs such, the semiannual reports and the mortgage foreclosure complaints, the existence of which indicate that the Gormans were most likely making mortgage payments to FSNB at the time the Group made the expenditures at issue, provide support for petitioner’s claim that respondents violated sections 9—8.10(a)(3) and 9—8.10(a)(4) of the Election Code by using the Group’s funds to reimburse Gerald Gorman for payments made on the Gormans’ mortgage with FSNB. The testimony of Walsh and Elizabeth Gorman did not effectively rebut that claim, and respondents did not present any other evidence, documentary or otherwise, to support their assertion that the expenditures were proper partial loan repayments made to Gerald Gorman’s personal account at FSNB. As such, we determine that the hearing examiner’s conclusion, which was adopted by the Board, that petitioner did not present any evidence showing that the expenditures at issue were anything other than partial loan repayments is clearly erroneous. We therefore also decide that counts IV and V of petitioner’s complaint have some basis in fact and law and appear to have been filed on justifiable grounds and conclude that the Board’s decision to dismiss those counts is clearly erroneous.\nIII. Count VII\nIn count VII of his complaint, petitioner alleged that respondents violated section 9—8.10(a)(11) of the Election Code by making expenditures to Gerald Gorman for loans that he never made and for services that he never rendered. A political committee shall not make an expenditure for payments to a public official’s family member unless it is “compensation for services actually rendered by that person.” 10 ILCS 5/9—8.10(a)(11) (West 2002).\nThe semiannual reports filed by the Group with the Board show that the Group made numerous alleged partial loan repayments to Gerald Gorman from 2002 through 2009. Having already decided that the identity of the party that loaned the Group $390,000 in 2002 is unclear from the evidence presented at the closed preliminary hearing, we now also determine that petitioner’s allegation that the Group made expenditures to Gerald Gorman for repayment of loans that he never made has some basis in fact and law and appears to have been filed on justifiable grounds. We therefore conclude that the Board’s dismissal of count VII for not being filed on justifiable grounds is clearly erroneous.\nPetitioner has not challenged the Board’s dismissal of the remaining counts of his complaint in this appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the portions of the Board’s order dismissing counts II, III, VI, and VIII of petitioner’s complaint and reverse the portions of the Board’s order dismissing counts I, IV V and VII. We therefore remand the matter to the Board to order a public hearing to be conducted on counts I, IY V and VII of petitioner’s complaint in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Election Code (10 ILCS 5/9—21 (West 2008)) and the Administrative Code (26 Ill. Adm. Code 125.310 et seq. (2010)).\nAffirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

He appeals, claiming the trial court denied him due process by not advising him of his right to testify and not verifying that he was knowingly and voluntarily waiving that right. He also claims the trial court’s order must be modified because his probation impermissibly extends beyond his twenty-first birthday. For the reasons below, we affirm as modified.\nBACKGROUND\nIn November 2008, the State filed a petition for adjudication of wardship claiming respondent, who was 16 years old, robbed a fellow student. The student and an adult witness identified respondent as the robber in separate photo arrays and testified at his delinquency proceeding. Respondent, who was represented by counsel, called his girlfriend, mother, and father as alibi witnesses. They testified that respondent was at home talking to his girlfriend on a landline telephone at the time of the robbery. Respondent, who was not advised by the trial court of his right to testify, did not testify. The trial court adjudicated respondent delinquent, stating:\n“We have witnesses, two eyewitnesses, to the event which is not often the case. Both of the eyewitnesses told internally consistent versions of what happened. There was not contradiction between one or the other.\nWhat I find compelling evidence here, too, is that both of the eyewitnesses identified the young man, Joshua B***, in photo arrays that — I believe one was held at the police station and I think the other one was at the house of Joshua B*** [sic]. So, these are obviously not done contemporaneously. So, we didn’t have a situation where it could be argued that one witness suggested an identification of another witness. They both picked out the same photo from that array.\nYou know, standing by themselves, each of those witnesses — I have big problems with a single-witness-identification case without other corroboration. We have two witnesses that both gave very compelling and consistent testimony that was very credible.\nOn the other side, we have an alibi defense that was put forth by family members. And I understand that that’s often what wit nesses are. There was — You know, it was interesting to me that the alibi defense really turned on phone calls; and yet, no corroboration of the phone calls was produced by way of records which is something that is available to the two people by way of subpoena and that that might have made an alibi a little bit more compelling than it was because there were inconsistencies between the stories.\nAnd so, I find that the State has proved this case beyond a reasonable doubt. I find that State’s witnesses more credible; and so, there will be a finding of delinquency, finding of guilty.”\nThe trial court placed respondent on 5 years’ probation, until April 7, 2014, and ordered him to perform 60 hours of community service. Respondent appeals, claiming the trial court denied him due process by failing to advise him of his right to testify and failing to verify that he knowingly and voluntarily waived that right. He also claims, and the State does not dispute, that his probation must be modified because it impermissibly extends beyond his twenty-first birthday.\nANALYSIS\nA. Respondent’s Adjudication Is Affirmed\n“A criminal defendant has a constitutional right to testify in his own defense, but that right may be waived. [Citation.] In order to effect waiver of his right to testify, a defendant is not required to execute a specific type of waiver, nor is the trial court required to ascertain whether a defendant’s silence is the result of a knowing and voluntary waiver to testify.” People v. Chatman, 357 Ill. App. 3d 695, 703 (2005).\n“When a defendant contends on appeal that he was precluded from testifying at trial, however, his conviction cannot be reversed on the basis that he was precluded from exercising his right to testify, unless he contemporaneously asserted his right to testify by informing the trial court that he wished to do so.” People v. Shelton, 252 Ill. App. 3d 193, 201 (1993).\nAccord People v. Smith, 176 Ill. 2d 217, 234 (1997). Respondent did not do so here, forfeiting the issue.\nWe will nonetheless examine the record for plain error, “a narrow and limited exception to the general waiver rule.” People v. Pastorino, 91 Ill. 2d 178, 188 (1982). It applies\n“when (1) a clear or obvious error occurred and the evidence is so closely balanced that the error alone threatened to tip the scales of justice against the defendant, regardless of the seriousness of the error, or (2) a clear or obvious error occurred and that error is so serious that it affected the fairness of the defendant’s trial and challenged the integrity of the judicial process, regardless of the closeness of the evidence.” People v. Piatkowski, 225 Ill. 2d 551, 565 (2007).\nRespondent claims the trial court erred by not informing him of his right to testify and not verifying that he knowingly and voluntarily waived that right. We find no such error.\n“Illinois courts have long held that when a defendant is represented by counsel, the trial court does not have a duty to tell a defendant of his right to testify. [Citation.] Rather, it is the defense counsel’s responsibility to advise a defendant about his right to testify and to explain any advantages or disadvantages of invoking that right. [Citation.] However, the ultimate decision of whether to testify is made by the defendant. [Citation.]\nWhen a defendant is represented by counsel, it is left to the discretion of the trial court whether to inform the defendant of the right against self-incrimination.” People v. Vaughn, 354 Ill. App. 3d 917, 925 (2004).\nRespondent acknowledges these principles, but maintains juvenile offenders are entitled to greater protection because “unlike an adult convicted felon, under prevailing law a juvenile offender has no right to file a post-conviction petition.” This court has expressly held that the Post-Conviction Hearing Act (725 ILCS 5/122 — 1 (West 2008)), a collateral remedy for most adult offenders, does not apply to juveniles. In re Thomas, 77 Ill. App. 3d 299, 300 (1979). Our supreme court recently declined to rule on the issue, however, stating:\n“J.T. requests this court to exercise its supervisory authority and address the issue of whether juveniles can seek relief under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act (725 ILCS 5/122 — 1 et seq. (West 2004)). We decline to do so for the same reasons we declined to address this issue in In re William M., 206 Ill. 2d 595 (2003). As in William M., the parties offer minimal argument on this issue. As Justice Kilbride noted in his special concurrence in that case, ‘[a] question of such magnitude should be fully briefed and argued by opposing parties zealously advocating the relevant arguments prior to its definitive resolution by this court.’ William M., 206 Ill. 2d at 607-08 (Kilbride, J., specially concurring).” In re J.T., 221 Ill. 2d 338, 348-49 (2006).\nNevertheless, in holding that criminal court judges have no duty to advise defendants of their right to testify this court identified three factors underlying that ruling unrelated to postconviction proceedings:\n“First, a defendant’s decision as to whether or not to testify is often made as the trial unfolds. [Citation.] By advising a defendant of his right to testify, a court could influence the defendant to waive his right not to testify, ‘thus threatening the exercise of this other, converse, constitutionally explicit and more fragile right.’ [Citations.]\nSecond, a court could intrude upon the attorney-client relationship by advising a defendant of his right to testify. [Citations.] ‘A trial judge must take great care not to assume the functions of trial counsel.’ [Citation.] It is primarily the responsibility of defense counsel, not the trial judge, to advise a defendant as to whether or not he should testify and to explain the tactical advantages and disadvantages of each option. [Citation.] If a trial judge were to advise a defendant, sua sponte, of his right to testify, such an act could frustrate a decision on the matter made by the defendant and defense counsel who are designing trial strategy. [Citation.]\nFinally, a trial judge is not required to inform a defendant of his right to testify because it is difficult for a judge to determine the appropriate time that he should advise a defendant concerning his right to testify, since ‘the judge cannot know that the defendant has not testified until the defense [rests and such a moment is not an opportune] time to engage in a discussion with the defendant which might lead to a rupture with defense counsel *** or might undo a trial strategy based on the defendant’s not testifying.’ [Citation.]” (Emphasis in original and omitted.) Shelton, 252 Ill. App. 3d at 202.\nWe find all of these factors equally applicable to proceedings under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 (705 ILCS 405/1 et seq. (West 2008)) (the Act), and note that section 1 — 5 of the Act assures that minors will be represented by counsel. 705 ILCS 405/1 — 5 (West 2008) (“No hearing on any petition or motion filed under this Act may be commenced unless the minor who is the subject of the proceeding is represented by counsel”). We therefore decline to adopt the bright-line rule advocated by respondent, and hold that the trial court did not have a duty to inform respondent sua sponte, who was represented by counsel, of his right to testify or verify that respondent was knowingly and voluntarily waiving that right.\nWe note that respondent does not actually claim that counsel did not advise him of his right to testify. While respondent argues that he cannot “reveal conversations he did or did not have with his attorney” because such matters are outside of the record, and “on direct appeal a reviewing court will not consider facts that are not part of the record,” that argument fails. If indeed respondent’s counsel did not inform him of his right to testify respondent could have made that assertion in his briefs to the court, noting that the matters were outside of the record, and presented his perceived inability to raise them before the trial court. See People v. Henderson, 217 Ill. 2d 449, 467-68 (2005). That would have allowed the State to respond to his claim and provided us a basis upon which to determine whether to consider his purported claim. Under this record, there is no claim before us regarding counsel’s conduct. We find no plain error and affirm respondent’s adjudication.\nB. Respondent’s Probation Is Modified\nOn April 7, 2009, the trial court placed respondent on 5 years’ probation, until April 7, 2014, and ordered him to perform 60 hours of community service. As section 5 — 755 of the Act (705 ILCS 405/5— 755 (West 2008)) requires respondent’s probation to terminate on his twenty-first birthday, June 27, 2013, we modify the trial court’s order accordingly.\nCONCLUSION\nRespondent has forfeited his due process claim, and the trial court did not commit plain error as it did not have a duty to inform respondent sua sponte of his right to testify or verify that respondent was voluntarily and knowingly waiving that right. We affirm the trial court’s order as modified.\nAffirmed as modified.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

Defendant appeals, contending that: (1) the State failed to prove him guilty of first degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) the State made prejudicial comments during its opening statement and closing and rebuttal arguments, depriving defendant of a fair trial. Defendant asks that we reduce his conviction to involuntary manslaughter or second degree murder and remand for resentencing, or that we reverse his conviction and remand for a new trial. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\nBACKGROUND\nOn July 31, 2005, Bonita McConnell was shot in the head and killed by a stray bullet while driving with her sister, Joyce Brooks, down Cicero Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.\nEarlier that day, defendant and his friends Peter Johnson, Juan Campos, and Rudy Cantu drove to a Wal-Mart store near the intersection of Cicero Avenue and West 72nd Street. All four men were part of or affiliated with the same street gang, the Two-Two Boys. While at the Wal-Mart, defendant and his friends attracted the attention of rival gang members Fidel Morales, Rene Jaime, and Gustavio Melecio. Although the men did not know each other, they recognized each other’s gang colors. The groups exchanged threatening looks, but no words, and hurried to their vehicles after leaving the store; defendant and his friends to Johnson’s blue Dodge Grand Caravan, and Morales and his friends to a black Lincoln Town Car.\nJohnson, a friend and coworker of defendant, testified that he was closely affiliated with, but not a member of, the Two-Two Boys. Johnson stated that after the two groups hurried to their vehicles, they circled each other and he waited for the Lincoln to leave the WalMart parking lot. After the Lincoln turned south onto Cicero Avenue, he waited a minute and did the same. Soon thereafter, he noticed the Lincoln positioned down the road in the exit lane of a service alley of a Target store, also located on Cicero Avenue. Johnson stated that he was afraid that the Lincoln would ram the side of his Caravan if he continued to drive on Cicero, so he pulled into the alley to avoid a possible collision, bringing his van alongside the Lincoln, separated only by a low triangular median. According to Johnson, Morales then opened the rear driver’s-side door of the Lincoln, threw something at his van and got back in the Lincoln. Johnson did not know what the thrown object was but he did not think it was a gun and he did not see anyone in the Lincoln with a weapon. After his van was hit, Johnson then began to drive down the alley. He then heard two gunshots and looked over to see defendant hanging out the front passenger window of the van and facing the Lincoln with a gun in hand. Defendant came back into the van and told Johnson to “f***ing drive” and “get the f*** out of here.” Johnson left the alley and drove down 79th Street toward Harlem Avenue, when a police officer, who had just received a dispatch about the shooting, pulled him over. Defendant handed the gun to Campos and told Johnson to “keep his f***ing mouth shut” and reminded him that he knew where his fiancee lived and his sister worked. Defendant, Campos, and Cantu then jumped out of the van and fled on foot. Additional police officers arrived and Johnson was questioned but did not say anything to the police about the shooting. After Joyce Brooks was brought to the scene but failed to positively identify the van, Johnson was allowed to leave with several traffic citations. He testified that approximately one month later defendant asked him to burn the van but he refused. On September 1, 2005, officers of the Chicago police department came to Johnson’s residence as part of their investigation of the killing, at which time he told them about the shooting and directed them to the residences of defendant, Campos, and Cantu.\nCampos testified that he was a member of the Two-Two Boys, as was everyone else in the van on the day of the shooting. He stated, in relevant part, that when Johnson pulled alongside the Lincoln in the service alley, he saw Morales jump out of the Lincoln and throw a bottle, or something similar, at the van. When the object struck the van, he ducked down in the rear seat, behind defendant, and could not see anything. Campos stated that as Johnson began to drive down the alley, he heard two gunshots several seconds apart, and when he looked up, he saw defendant coming back into the passenger-side window, telling Johnson to “get the f*** out of here.” As Johnson pulled away, Campos said that defendant laughed and said “that’s what those pussies get.” Campos stated that when the van was later pulled over on 79th Street, defendant handed him the gun and they both fled. Campos and defendant ran into a nearby residential yard and defendant told him to hide the gun in a pile of wood logs. Campos hid the gun and the two men parted ways. Campos testified that in a subsequent telephone conversation defendant gave him the impression that he had disposed of the gun, telling Campos not to “trip,” “I got that. Good job.” On cross-examination, Campos said that he did not actually see Morales throw something at the van because he was already ducked down in fear that Morales was shooting at them. On redirect examination, however, he stated that he saw Morales throw something at the van.\nCantu, who was in the back of the van with Campos, testified, in relevant part, that he told Johnson to pull into the service alley alongside the Lincoln. He stated that he saw Morales jump out of the Lincoln, but he then ducked down and did not see Morales throw anything. Cantu was impeached with a sworn statement he gave to the police and with his grand jury testimony, in which he stated that he saw Morales throw something at the van. Cantu further testified that as Johnson pulled away, he saw the Lincoln turn around, at which point Johnson slowed down and defendant leaned out the window and fired a gun once or twice in the direction of the Lincoln. He stated that defendant had his shirt pulled over the bottom half of his face. He also stated that he never saw anyone in the Lincoln with a weapon. Cantu confirmed that when Johnson was later pulled over by the police, defendant handed Campos the gun before fleeing. He stated that he also ran from the police because of the shooting and because he was carrying marijuana. Cantu denied later speaking to defendant about the shooting, but was again impeached with his sworn statement, in which he stated that defendant told him to “just forget about it” and “[y]ou don’t know nothing.” On cross-examination, Cantu agreed with defense counsel that he saw a metal object in Morales’s hand as he jumped out of the Lincoln, that he thought it was a gun, that he thought Morales was shooting at the van, and that after Johnson began to drive down the alley he thought the Lincoln turned to come after them.\nMorales testified that he was previously a member of the Satan’s Disciples gang, a rival of the Two-Two Boys. He stated that he and several of his friends went to Wal-Mart on July 31, 2005, to buy spray paint. While at Wal-Mart, they saw defendant’s group and exchanged threatening looks for several minutes. They left the store soon after defendant’s group, hurried to their vehicle and left the parking lot, turning south on Cicero Avenue. Morales said that before they pulled out of the parking lot, he saw defendant in the van with his shirt pulled up to cover the bottom half of his face. He testified that they were immediately caught in traffic on Cicero Avenue and pulled into the service alley to turn around when Johnson’s van pulled up next to them. Morales said that he then stepped out of the Lincoln and threw a spray paint can at the van. The van began to drive down the alley as Jaime turned around and into the alley entrance lane. Defendant was ducking down, but he said that he could see someone with a t-shirt pulled over his face leaning out of the front passenger window of the van. Morales did not see defendant fire the gun, but he heard three gunshots. He stated that after the gunshots Jaime immediately pulled out of the alley and drove away.\nJaime testified that he is a member of the Party People gang, a rival of the Two-Two Boys. His testimony largely tracked that of Morales. Jaime stated that he was driving the Lincoln, and after leaving Wal-Mart, he mistakenly turned south onto Cicero Avenue and pulled into the service alley to turn around. Johnson’s van then pulled along side his Lincoln, Morales jumped out and threw the paint can, and the van began to drive down the alley. Jaime stated that he then turned his car around to face the van. Although he initially testified that he did so without the intention of ramming the van, he later admitted that he planned on ramming it if its occupants did anything he perceived to be more threatening. He then saw someone with a partially covered face lean out the front passenger-side window with a gun and shoot at him. Jaime heard two gunshots and immediately turned the car around and drove away.\nThe State presented a number of other witnesses, including police officers and forensic scientists and investigators. They testified, in relevant part, that a spray paint can and two cartridge cases fired from a semiautomatic weapon were recovered at the scene of the shooting. The medical examiner determined that Bonita McConnell was killed by a gunshot wound to the left side of her head. Defendant did not challenge the State’s forensic evidence, which established, inter alia, that the two cartridge cases were fired from the same 9-millimeter weapon and that Morales’s fingerprints were found on the lid of the spray paint can.\nTestifying on his own behalf, defendant admitted that he killed Bonita McConnell, although he stated that he did not know it until Cantu told him a week later. Defendant testified that before entering the alley, Campos handed him the gun that killed McConnell. He stated that when Johnson drove into the alley he saw an object that he believed to be a handgun in Morales’s hand, and when he heard something hit the van, he believed Morales was shooting at them. Defendant stated that at the time of the shooting he was afraid for his life and the lives of his friends. He said that he fired the gun to scare off the men in the Lincoln and he did not intend to hurt or kill anyone. He further said that he shot the gun with his weak hand, did not aim, intended to fire only once, and shot up and to the side of the Lincoln. Defendant denied saying “that’s what those pussies get,” denied threatening Johnson, denied asking Johnson to burn the van, and denied disposing of the gun after hiding it in the pile of wood logs. Defendant also recounted an incident that occurred in November 2004 when he was shot and a fellow gang member was killed by an unidentified assailant. Defendant stated that this incident contributed to his feeling that his life was in danger on July 31, 2005. On cross-examination, defendant conceded that he shot in the direction of Cicero Avenue.\nOn June 11, 2007, although the trial court allowed a second degree murder and involuntary manslaughter instruction, the jury returned a general verdict finding defendant guilty of the first degree murder of Bonita McConnell. Defendant’s motion for a new trial was denied and he was sentenced to 47 years of imprisonment. This appeal followed.\nANALYSIS\nI. The State Met Its Burden for First Degree Murder\nDefendant first claims the State failed to prove him guilty of first degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt.\n“When a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, a criminal conviction will not be set aside unless the evidence is so improbable or unsatisfactory that it creates reasonable doubt of defendant’s guilt. [Citation.] It is not within the purview of the reviewing court to retry a defendant where the sufficiency of the evidence is at issue. [Citation.] Rather, it is the responsibility of the trier of fact to determine the credibility of witnesses, the weight to be given to their testimony and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence. [Citation.] The relevant question on review is whether, after considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation.]” People v. Rodriguez, 336 Ill. App. 3d 1, 14-15 (2002).\n“[T]he reviewing court must allow all reasonable inferences from the record in favor of the prosecution.” People v. Cunningham, 212 Ill. 2d 274, 280 (2004).\nDefendant maintains that his conviction should be reduced to the lesser offense of involuntary manslaughter because the evidence below established only reckless conduct. The State responds that there is no question defendant killed Bonita McConnell and the evidence sufficiently establishes that he did so with the requisite mental state for a first degree murder conviction.\n“A person who kills an individual without lawful justification commits first degree murder if, in performing the acts which cause the death:\n(1) he either intends to kill or do great bodily harm to that individual or another, or knows that such acts will cause death to that individual or another; or\n(2) he knows that such acts create a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to that individual or another; or\n(3) he is attempting or committing a forcible felony other than second degree murder.” 720 ILCS 5/9—1(a) (West 2008).\n“A person intends, or acts intentionally or with intent, to accomplish a result or engage in conduct described by the statute defining the offense, when his conscious objective or purpose is to accomplish that result or engage in that conduct.” 720 ILCS 5/4—4 (West 2008). “A person knows, or acts knowingly or with knowledge of *** [t]he result of his or her conduct, described by the statute defining the offense, when he or she is consciously aware that such result is practically certain to be caused by his conduct.” 720 ILCS 5/4—5 (West 2008). “Determination of defendant’s mental state may be inferred from circumstantial evidence, and this task is particularly suited to the jury.” People v. Moore, 358 Ill. App. 3d 683, 688 (2005).\n•1 Here, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, a rational trier of fact could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant intended to kill or do great bodily harm to another or that he knew his acts created a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to another. It is undisputed that defendant killed Bonita McConnell. His intent to kill can be inferred from the act of firing two bullets in the direction of an occupied car and a crowded street (People v. Smith, 258 Ill. App. 3d 1003, 1027 (1994) (“[t]he intent to murder can be inferred from the act of firing a gun at a person because the natural tendency of such an act is to destroy another’s life”)), and his words and conduct after the shooting. The fact that defendant killed Bonita McConnell, instead of one of the occupants of the Lincoln, does not mean that he acted without the requisite intent. “Under the doctrine of transferred intent, if a defendant shoots at one person[ ] with the intent to kill, but kills an unintended victim, he may be convicted of the crime of murder for the death of the unintended victim.” People v. Thompson, 313 Ill. App. 3d 510, 516 (2000). Alternatively, it is not unreasonable to conclude that defendant knew that his actions were practically certain to result in the death or substantial injury of another. See People v. Lake, 298 Ill. App. 3d 50, 54 (1998) (“Intentionally firing a weapon at an occupied building is an act that has a natural tendency to cause death or great bodily harm and is of such a character as to defeat any assertion of recklessness.”); accord People v. Mimms, 312 Ill. App. 3d 226, 231 (2000) (defendant presumed to know that firing a gun at an occupied home created a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to the occupants of that home).\nAlthough defendant argues that his testimony established that he fired up and away from the Lincoln and that he did not intend to kill or injure anyone, the jury’s apparent decision to disregard his account was not unreasonable in light of the other witnesses’ statements and the physical evidence. For example, the death of Bonita McConnell, who was driving behind and perpendicular to the Lincoln, can support the conclusion that defendant did not fire up and away from the Lincoln and Cicero Avenue; a conclusion also supported by the testimony of Johnson and Jaime. Further, the fact that defendant had the gun and pulled his shirt over his face before entering the alley strongly suggests that he intended to do harm. It was not unreasonable for the jury to conclude that defendant fired at the Lincoln with the intent to kill or cause great bodily harm to its occupants, or that he acted with the knowledge that doing so was practically certain to result in the death or substantial injury of another.\nIn reaching this conclusion, the court rejects defendant’s assertion that this case is analogous to People v. Andersch, 107 Ill. App. 3d 810 (1982), and People v. Hoover, 250 Ill. App. 3d 338 (1993), both of which stated that pointing a loaded gun at another can constitute recklessness. Andersch and Hoover involved defendants who accidentally discharged their weapons. Here, defendant did not accidentally fire his weapon. Defendant’s argument that Andersch and Hoover are controlling because in those cases the “defendants consciously disregarded the substantial risks in pointing a loaded gun at another person, just as Garcia consciously disregarded the substantial risks presented by firing the gun in the direction of the Lincoln and Cicero Avenue,” is unconvincing. Given the facts presented at trial, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that defendant intentionally fired his weapon at the Lincoln in the direction of Cicero Avenue and that he did so with the intent or knowledge required of first degree murder.\nII. Second Degree Murder Is Not Warranted\n•2 Defendant contends, alternatively, that we should reduce his conviction to second degree murder because the evidence establishes that he acted under an unreasonable belief that the use of deadly force was justified. A second degree murder conviction is appropriate where, inter alia, “at the time of the killing [the defendant] believes the circumstances to be such that, if they existed, would justify or exonerate the killing under the principles stated in Article 7 of this Code [(720 ILCS 5/7—1 et seq. (West 2008))], but his or her belief [was] unreasonable.” 720 ILCS 5/9—2(a)(2) (West 2008). Defendant bears the burden of proving this mitigating factor by a preponderance of the evidence. 720 ILCS 5/9—2(c) (West 2008). In other words, “[o]nce the State has proven first-degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence *** that he believed that the circumstances justified using self-defense, but that his belief was unreasonable.” People v. Hawkins, 296 Ill. App. 3d 830, 836 (1998).\n“To establish self-defense, the defendant must show some evidence that unlawful force was threatened against him; the danger of harm was imminent; he was not the aggressor; that he actually believed that a danger existed, force was necessary to avert the danger, and the type and amount of force was necessary; and that his beliefs were reasonable. [Citations.] While the law does not require the aggressor to be armed for self-defense to be justified, it must appear that the aggressor is capable of inflicting serious bodily harm without the use of a deadly weapon, and is intending to do so. [Citations.]” Id. at 837.\nDefendant maintains that because the evidence established that he had an actual, albeit unreasonable, belief in the necessity of using deadly force in self-defense, the trial court erred in not reducing his conviction to second degree murder. The State responds that there was ample evidence to support the conclusion that defendant did not believe his actions were necessary to protect his life and, therefore, that he was not acting in self-defense. We agree.\n“Wfliether a killing is justified under the law of self-defense is a question of fact [citations], and the fact finder is not required to accept as true the defendant’s evidence in support of that defense [citations]. Instead, the trier of fact is obliged to consider the probability or improbability of the evidence, the circumstances sur rounding the event, and all of the witnesses’ testimony. [Citations.]” People v. Huddleston, 243 Ill. App. 3d 1012, 1018-19 (1993).\nIn the case sub judice, defendant offered some evidence that he was acting in self-defense. The occupants of both vehicles confirmed that they belonged to rival gangs, that the groups exchanged menacing looks at the Wal-Mart, that Morales jumped out of the Lincoln with something in his hand when Johnson’s van drove into the alley, that something then hit the van, and that the Lincoln turned to face the van as the latter drove away. However, the State supplied testimony rebutting defendant’s self-defense claim. For instance, the State introduced uncontradicted testimony that defendant had a gun and pulled his shirt over his face before entering the alley and that Johnson was driving away when defendant shot at the Lincoln. The State also introduced testimony that after firing the gun at the Lincoln, defendant laughed and said “that’s what those pussies get,” then fled from the police, told his friends to keep quiet about the incident, and destroyed or tried to destroy evidence. None of this behavior suggests self-defense. Given this testimony, it was reasonable for the jury to disregard defendant’s testimony and conclude that defendant was the aggressor. We therefore affirm defendant’s first degree murder conviction.\nIII. The State’s Opening, Closing and Rebuttal Remarks Did Not Constitute Plain Error and Defendant Forfeited Any Objection to Those Remarks on Appeal\n•3 Finally, defendant argues that he was denied a fair trial because the State made prejudicial remarks during its opening statement and closing and rebuttal arguments. The State responds that defendant waived any challenge to the remarks made at trial by his failure to preserve his objections. “In order to preserve an issue for review, the general rule is that a defendant must both object at trial and file a written post-trial motion raising the issue.” People v. Anderson, 250 Ill. App. 3d 439, 451 (1993). Defendant does not contest that he failed to properly preserve his objections by objecting to the State’s comments at trial and raising those objections in his posttrial motion. Instead, he asserts that the State’s remarks constitute plain error and therefore avoid the general forfeiture rule. We disagree.\n“Plain error is a narrow and limited exception to the general waiver rule.” People v. Pastorino, 91 Ill. 2d 178, 188 (1982).\n“[T]he plain-error doctrine allows a reviewing court to consider unpreserved error when (1) a clear or obvious error occurred and the evidence is so closely balanced that the error alone threatened to tip the scales of justice against the defendant, regardless of the seriousness of the error, or (2) a clear or obvious error occurred and that error is so serious that it affected the fairness of the defendant’s trial and challenged the integrity of the judicial process, regardless of the closeness of the evidence.” People v. Piatkowski, 225 Ill. 2d 551, 565 (2007).\nThe first prong of this test applies “where the evidence in a case is so closely balanced that the jury’s guilty verdict may have resulted from the error and not the evidence.” People v. Herron, 215 Ill. 2d 167, 178 (2005). With regard to the second prong, “plain error review is equated with structural error.” People v. Brazziel, 406 Ill. App. 3d 412, 427 (2010).\n“An error is typically designated as ‘structural’ and requiring automatic reversal only if it necessarily renders a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or unreliable in determining guilt or innocence. [Citation.] The Supreme Court has held an error is structural only in a ‘very limited class of cases.’ [Citation.] Structural errors include a complete denial of counsel, denial of self-representation at trial, trial before a biased judge, denial of a public trial, racial discrimination in the selection of a grand jury, and a defective reasonable doubt instruction. [Citation.]” People v. Averett, 237 Ill. 2d 1, 12-13 (2010).\nUnder both prongs “the burden of persuasion remains with the defendant.” Herron, 215 Ill. 2d at 187. The court will consider each of the complained-of statements in turn.\nIn its opening statement, the State said that Bonita McConnell’s death was “a result of nonsense that occurs in our streets, nonsense that has to stop, nonsense that stops with your verdict, nonsense that will stop when you come back with a verdict for the offense of first degree murder.” Defendant argues that this statement was designed to appeal to the jury’s prejudices and constituted plain error.\n“The purpose of an opening statement is to apprise the jury of what each party expects the evidence to prove. [Citation.] An opening statement may include a discussion of the expected evidence and reasonable inferences from the evidence. [Citations.] No statement may be made in opening which counsel does not intend to prove or cannot prove. [Citation.] *** Reversible error occurs only where the prosecutor’s opening comments are attributable to deliberate misconduct of the prosecutor and result in substantial prejudice to the defendant. [Citation.]” (Emphasis in original.) People v. Kliner, 185 Ill. 2d 81, 127 (1998).\nAlthough argumentative comments are generally improper in opening statements, the evidence in this case was not closely balanced such that the State’s comments threatened to tip the balance against defendant. Defendant admitted that he killed Bonita McConnell, and for the reasons stated above, we do not believe that the evidence regarding his self-defense claim was close. Nor is the error complained of structural. We find that the State’s opening remarks did not constitute plain error and defendant forfeited his objection to them.\nThe same can be said of the State’s comments in its closing and rebuttal arguments, in which it referred to defendant’s self-defense theory as “ridiculous” and “insulting,” and referenced any second degree murder conviction as “a travesty” of justice. Defendant argues that in making these statements, the State improperly ridiculed his theory of the case and suggested that the defense was lying and hiding the truth. Defendant also complains of statements made by the State in its rebuttal urging that the jury do, and that Bonita McConnell and her family deserve, justice.\n“It is well settled that great latitude is afforded a prosecutor during closing argument [citation], and that the propriety of the prosecution’s remarks is generally left to the discretion of the trial court ***. In closing argument, the prosecution may base its argument on the evidence presented or reasonable inferences therefrom [citation]; respond to those comments by defense counsel which clearly invite or provoke a response [citation]; comment on the credibility of the defense witnesses [citation]; denounce the activities of defendants and urge that justice be administered [citation]; highlight inconsistencies in defendant’s argument [citation]; and comment on defendant’s absence at trial [citation].” People v. Morrison, 137 Ill. App. 3d 171, 184 (1985).\nIn the instant case, we have carefully reviewed the closing and rebuttal arguments, paying particular attention to the remarks of which defendant complains, and conclude that the State’s comments do not constitute plain error. The remarks were either within the bounds of a proper closing or rebuttal argument or, if improper, cannot be said to have impacted the jury’s decision in light of the evidence of defendant’s guilt. See People v. Gray, 252 Ill. App. 3d 362, 368-69 (1993) (prosecutor’s characterization of defendant’s theory of the case as “so ridiculous that it isn’t even worthy of comment” not reversible error); People v. Belvedere, 72 Ill. App. 3d 998, 1020 (1979) (prosecutor’s exhortation to jury not to “cop-out” by returning voluntary manslaughter verdict based on defendant’s testimony not reversible error because it concerned defendant’s credibility). This is especially true in light of the trial court’s detailed jury instructions, in which it stated, inter alia, that “[n] either opening statements nor closing arguments are evidence and any statement or arguments made by the attorney which is not based on the evidence should be disregarded.” The State’s remarks did not constitute plain error; therefore, defendant forfeited any objection to those remarks on appeal.\nCONCLUSION\nFor all the foregoing reasons, we affirm defendant’s conviction for first degree murder.\nAffirmed.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

The circuit court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiff’s complaint pursuant to section 2—619(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2—619(a) (West 2008)). We affirm.\nBACKGROUND\nDefendants were involved in a hit-and-run car accident on February 2, 2004, and they subsequently filed a claim under the uninsured motorist provision of their auto insurance policy, which had been issued by plaintiff. However, the vehicle was later stolen before plaintiff could inspect it for purposes of evaluating the claim. Although the vehicle was later recovered, it was junked prior to being inspected.\nOn January 27, 2005, plaintiff filed a declaratory judgment action in the circuit court of Cook County, which asked the circuit court to find that defendants’ claim was not covered under the policy and that the policy was void due to defendants’ alleged spoliation of evidence. However, the insurance policy contained an arbitration provision, as required by section 143a(1) of the Illinois Insurance Code (215 ILCS 5/143a(1) (West 2002)). Plaintiff moved to stay arbitration pending resolution of the declaratory judgment action. The circuit court denied plaintiff’s motion to stay and ordered that the parties proceed to arbitration on all issues, notably including the issue of coverage.\nPlaintiff appealed the trial court’s order declining to stay arbitration, and we reversed. See United Automobile Insurance Co. v. Wilson, No. 1—05—0372 (Mar. 16, 2005) (unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23). We found that the circuit court had erred by ordering the parties into arbitration before deciding whether the policy covered the 2004 accident. We noted that this issue is controlled by State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Yapejian, 152 Ill. 2d 533 (1992), which held that arbitration under section 143a(1) is limited to only “disputes concerning covered claims, once coverage was established.” Id. at 541. Under Yapejian, whether or not coverage exists is an issue for the circuit court to determine. Once the circuit court finds that a particular claim is covered, section 143a(1) mandates that any disputes over that claim be arbitrated. We consequently reversed and remanded “with instructions to stay arbitration pending resolution of the coverage issues by the trial court.” United Automobile Insurance Co., slip op. at 4.\nPlaintiff did not move for a stay of the arbitration during the appeal, and while the appeal was pending, the arbitration had commenced. The arbitrator heard evidence on all issues, including coverage, but the arbitrator had not issued a ruling by the time we resolved the appeal. After receiving our mandate, the circuit court stayed arbitration and proceeded to a bench trial on the coverage issue.\nOn February 1, 2007, the circuit court issued a written memorandum opinion and order. The circuit court found that no spoliation of evidence had occurred and that the uninsured motorist provision of the insurance policy covered the 2004 accident. Having found that coverage existed, the circuit court compelled arbitration on the remaining disputes. Plaintiff appealed the circuit court’s ruling, and we affirmed. See United Automobile Insurance Co. v. Wilson, No. 1—07—0424 (Sept. 4, 2007) (unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23).\nHowever, plaintiff again did not obtain a stay of arbitration pending appeal, so arbitration resumed after trial. On May 24, 2007, the arbitrator issued an award in favor of defendants in the amount of $11,000 to Woodrow Wilson and $9,000 to Sidney Wilson. Six days later, on May 30, 2007, plaintiff filed the instant declaratory judgment action in the circuit court of Cook County seeking to vacate the arbitration award. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted on October 13, 2009. The circuit court subsequently confirmed the arbitration award and entered judgment in favor of defendants on October 29, 2009. Plaintiff timely appealed, and this case is now before us for the third time.\nANALYSIS\nPlaintiffs brief on appeal leaves a great deal to be desired in terms of clarity of argument and legal support. Despite the briefs convoluted drafting and sparse legal citation, we perceive that plaintiffs primary argument is that the arbitration award is void because arbitration commenced before the circuit court determined the issue of coverage.\nWe review an order of dismissal under section 2 — 619(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure de novo, accepting as true all well-pled facts contained in the complaint and in any uncontradicted affidavits attached to the motion. See Coady v. Harpo, Inc., 308 Ill. App. 3d 153, 158-59 (1999). The question on review is “ ‘whether the existence of a genuine issue of material fact should have precluded the dismissal or, absent such an issue of fact, whether dismissal is proper as a matter of law.’ ” Doyle v. Holy Cross Hospital, 186 Ill. 2d 104, 110 (1999) (quoting Kedzie &amp; 103rd Currency Exchange, Inc. v. Hodge, 156 Ill. 2d 112, 116-17 (1993)).\n•1 Judicial review of a binding arbitration award is more limited than review of a decision of the trial court (Rauh v. Rockford Products Corp., 143 Ill. 2d 377, 394 (1991)), and we will construe an award so as to uphold it whenever possible (Garver v. Ferguson, 76 Ill. 2d 1, 10 (1979)). Under section 143a of the Illinois Insurance Code, “[a]ny decision made by the arbitrators shall be binding for the amount of damages not exceeding $50,000 for bodily injury to or death of any one person, $100,000 for bodily injury to or death of 2 or more persons in any one motor vehicle accident, or the corresponding policy limits for bodily injury or death, whichever is less.” 215 ILCS 5/143a (West 2008). A binding arbitration award under section 143a is subject to only limited judicial review under section 12 of the Uniform Arbitration Act (710 ILCS 5/12 (West 2008)). See Reed v. Farmers Insurance Croup, 188 Ill. 2d 168, 172 (1999).\n•2 Because the total arbitration award in favor of both defendants was only $20,000, it is binding and subject to only limited judicial review. Under the Uniform Arbitration Act, a binding award may only be vacated where\n“(1) The award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means;\n(2) There was evident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral or corruption in any one of the arbitrators or misconduct prejudicing the rights of any party;\n(3) The arbitrators exceeded their powers;\n(4) The arbitrators refused to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown therefor or refused to hear evidence material to the controversy or otherwise so conducted the hearing, contrary to the provisions of Section 5 [(710 ILCS 5/5 (West 2008))], as to prejudice substantially the rights of a party; or\n(5) There was no arbitration agreement and the issue was not adversely determined in proceedings under Section 2 [(710 ILCS 5/2 (West 2008))] and the party did not participate in the arbitration hearing without raising the objection; but the fact that the relief was such that it could not or would not be granted by the circuit court is not ground for vacating or refusing to confirm the award.” 710 ILCS 5/12 (West 2008).\nIllinois case law has also established that an award may be vacated “if it results in the contravention of a paramount consideration of public policy [citation], where a gross error of law or fact appears on the face of the award [citation], or where the award fails to dispose of all matters properly submitted to the arbitrators [citation].” Edward Electric Co. v. Automation, Inc., 229 Ill. App. 3d 89, 97-98 (1992).\nIn its brief on appeal plaintiff repeatedly asserts that the award was “void ab initio” because arbitration proceedings commenced before the circuit court determined the coverage issue. It appears that plaintiff intends to base its argument on section 12(a)(3) of the Uniform Arbitration Act (710 ILCS 5/12(a)(3) (West 2008)), on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by hearing evidence before coverage was determined by the circuit court.\n•3 We presume that arbitrators act within their authority, and the scope of an arbitrator’s powers is expressed by the arbitration agreement. See Rauh v. Rockford Products Corp., 143 Ill. 2d 377 (1991). However, plaintiff does not appear to have included a copy of the insurance policy or relevant arbitration clause in the record, nor has plaintiff directed our attention to where it might be found if it exists. It is the appellant’s burden to provide a complete record for the appeal. See Altafv. Hanover Square Condominium Ass’n No. 1, 188 Ill. App. 3d 533, 539 (1989); see also Mielke v. Condell Memorial Hospital, 124 Ill. App. 3d 42, 48-49 (1984) (noting that we are “not obligated to search the record for evidence supporting reversal of the trial court”); Ill. S. Ct. R 341(h)(7) (eff. July 1, 2008). Absent a complete record, “[a]ny doubts which may arise from the incompleteness of the record will be resolved against the appellant.” Foutch v. O’Bryant, 99 Ill. 2d 389, 392 (1984). Because the arbitration agreement does not appear to be part of the record, we must presume that the arbitrator acted within the scope of his powers when issuing the award.\n•4 To the extent that plaintiff asserts that our reversal of the circuit court’s arbitration order voided all later arbitration proceedings and any award based on them, we reject this contention. Our mandate to the circuit court in that order was “to stay arbitration pending resolution of the coverage issues by the trial court.” (Emphasis added.) United Automobile Insurance Co. v. Wilson, No. 1—05—0372, slip op. at 4 (Mar. 16, 2005) (unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23). We did not vacate any portion of the arbitration proceedings that had occurred prior to that point, but rather ordered that the proceedings be stayed until the coverage issue had been resolved. A stay does not vacate anything, but it is instead only the “postponement or halting of a proceeding, judgment, or the like.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1425 (7th ed. 1999); cf. 7-Eleven, Inc. v. Dar, 363 Ill. App. 3d 41, 45 (2005) (“The substantive effect of our order vacating the entire arbitration award was to restore the parties to their original status in the case, i.e., as though the arbitration award had never been entered.”). Plaintiff misreads the plain meaning of our order, and its reliance on that decision in support of vacating the arbitration award is misplaced.\nMoreover, the only case that plaintiff cites in support of this argument is Yapejian, which held merely that the issue of coverage is not subject to arbitration. See Yapejian, 152 Ill. 2d at 541. Yapejian did not hold that arbitration proceedings may not begin before the coverage issue is determined. Regardless of whether the arbitrator may have heard evidence on the coverage issue, the record is clear that he did not decide whether coverage existed. Yapejian consequently has no bearing on the question of whether the award should be vacated.\n•5 There is no indication in the record before us that the arbitrator exceeded his authority, and therefore any argument that the award should be vacated on that ground fails. Plaintiff does not raise on appeal any additional basis to vacate the award, and we therefore affirm the orders of the circuit court dismissing the complaint and confirming the arbitration award.\nWe note that plaintiff asks in its brief that if we find that the award should be vacated, then we should order that the arbitrator be replaced on remand due to alleged bias against plaintiff. Because plaintiff has not raised this issue as a reason to vacate the award and we find that the award should be confirmed, we do not reach this argument. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 341(h)(7) (eff. July 1, 2008) (“Points not argued are waived and shall not be raised in the reply brief, in oral argument, or on petition for rehearing.”).\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court dismissing the complaint and confirming the arbitration award is affirmed.\nAffirmed.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

The action was dismissed with regard to Clayton, but the circuit court granted a summary judgment in favor of plaintiff and denied State Farm’s motion for a summary judgment. State Farm now appeals, arguing the trial court erred in granting a summary judgment in favor of plaintiff. We affirm.\nFACTS\nClayton’s home, located at 2101 Jerome Lane in Cahokia, was insured by State Farm. On August 23, 2008, a fire destroyed her home, prompting Clayton to file a claim with State Farm. Clayton hired plaintiff to assist her in adjusting her claim. Clayton and plaintiff entered into a contract dated August 25, 2008. The contract states as follows:\n“I [Clayton] hereby authorize Golub and Associates to assist me in the adjustment of my fire loss with the insurance companies insuring my property at 2101 Jerome Lane, Cahokia, IL, and which occurred on 8-23-08, for which I agree to pay them on the receipt of my drafts in payment of said loss the sum equal to 10% of the amount of the adjustment. I, hereby, assign to them all money becoming due to the extent of the fee for adjusting said loss. It is understood that no settlement is to be made without my approval.”\nAce Hart, an agent employed by plaintiff, signed on behalf of plaintiff.\nOn August 26, 2008, Hart notified State Farm by facsimile and regular mail of plaintiff’s contract with Clayton and plaintiffs lien on the insurance proceeds and asked that plaintiffs name be included on any payments made to Clayton. Plaintiff negotiated a settlement with State Farm to Clayton in the amount of $72,076.58. Initially, State Farm issued a check to both plaintiff and Clayton.\nOn November 14, 2008, Clayton gave oral notice to State Farm that she was terminating her contract with plaintiff and requested that plaintiff not be named on any checks State Farm paid to her. On November 21, 2008, Clayton gave written notice to State Farm that she terminated her contract with plaintiff. Thereafter, State Farm complied with Clayton’s request not to include plaintiff as a payee and reissued a check with only Clayton as a payee.\nOn February 26, 2009, plaintiff filed suit against Clayton and State Farm. Count I was directed against Clayton and alleged that she breached her contract with plaintiff. Count II was directed against State Farm and alleged that State Farm was liable for plaintiff’s claimed fees because plaintiff had a lien on Clayton’s insurance proceeds which State Farm failed to honor. Plaintiff and State Farm filed cross-motions for a summary judgment on count II. On July 31, 2009, the trial court granted a summary judgment in favor of plaintiff and entered a judgment against State Farm in the amount of $7,562.85. State Farm now appeals.\nANALYSIS\nState Farm argues that the trial court erred in granting a summary judgment in favor of plaintiff. State Farm first contends that plaintiff did not have a valid lien on Clayton’s insurance proceeds because the Illinois Insurance Code (215 ILCS 5/1 et seq. (West 2008)) does not create a statutory lien in favor of public adjusters and State Farm’s only duty was to its insured. Plaintiff replies that its contract with Clayton was an adequate basis for a lien and that section 512.52 of the Illinois Insurance Code (215 ILCS 5/512.52 (West 2008)) provides the proper statutory authority for the lien. We agree with plaintiff.\nSection 512.52 of the Illinois Insurance Code is a definitions section that provides in pertinent part as follows:\n“(a) ‘Adjusting insurance claims’ means representing an insured with an insurer for compensation[ ] and while representing that insured either negotiating values, damages, or depreciation[ ] or applying the loss circumstances to insurance policy provisions.\n(b) ‘Public Insurance Adjuster’ means a person engaged in the business of adjusting insurance claims who is licensed pursuant to this Article.\n***\n(d) ‘Compensation’ shall include, but need not be limited to, the following:\n1. any assignment of insurance proceeds or a percentage thereof;\n2. any agreement to make repairs for the amount of the insurance proceeds payable;\n3. assertion of any lien against insurance proceeds payable.” (Emphasis added.) 215 ILCS 5/512.52(a), (b), (d) (West 2008).\nWe agree with plaintiff that our General Assembly’s choice of the word “lien” in the statute indicates its intention to make a lien enforceable against payments which have not yet occurred.\nThe instant situation presents a classic case in which a party who has been provided a service attempts to hustle the provider out of its fee. Here, plaintiff adjusted the claim on behalf of Clayton against State Farm; however, once the claim was adjusted, Clayton attempted to “fire” plaintiff. We agree with plaintiff that no one should be expected to work in a profession that would allow clients to fire the professional after the professional’s services were rendered unless there is an avenue to ensure payment. By specifically using the term “lien,” our General Assembly ensured that public insurance adjusters would be safeguarded against the type of situation presented here.\nThe contract specifically authorized plaintiff to assist Clayton in the adjustment of her fire loss that occurred on August 23, 2008. In exchange for plaintiffs services, Clayton agreed to pay plaintiff “10% of the amount of the adjustment.” Clayton assigned to plaintiff “all money becoming due to the extent of the fee for adjusting said loss.” Plaintiff gave notice to State Farm of its contract with Clayton.\nPlaintiff then went about assessing the value of Clayton’s fire-damaged property, contacted contractors, and negotiated a settlement with State Farm on Clayton’s behalf in the amount of $72,076.58. Shortly after the settlement was negotiated, Clayton “fired” plaintiff. Clayton refused to pay and asked State Farm to issue a new check. State Farm originally recognized the lien when it issued a check to both plaintiff and Clayton, but State Farm went along with Clayton’s request and reissued a check without plaintiff’s name. Here, the contract signed by Clayton created the lien, and State Farm should have honored the lien.\nWe are aware that chapter 770 of the Illinois Compiled Statutes creates lien rights in favor of numerous occupations and professions, such as attorneys (770 ILCS 5/1 (West 2008)) and health care professions, including physicians and dentists (770 ILCS 23/10 (West 2008)), but fails to specifically discuss liens with regard to public insurance adjusters. However, nowhere in chapter 770 does it state that these are the only liens that can be recognized. Chapter 770 is not meant to be comprehensive, and thus, we disagree with State Farm’s assertion that because chapter 770 of the Illinois Compiled Statutes fails to specifically set forth that public insurance adjusters shall have a lien, no such lien can exist.\nHeritage/Pullman Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., 104 Ill. App. 3d 1058, 433 N.E.2d 1034 (1982), supports our holding that a lien was created here. In that case, the owner of a shopping center retained a public insurance adjuster to assist in its claim with State Farm involving a collapsed roof. As in the instant case, a contract was entered into in which the insured owner of the shopping center agreed to pay the public insurance adjuster 10% of the amount of the agreed-upon loss. Heritage/Pullman Bank &amp; Trust Co., 104 Ill. App. 3d at 1059, 433 N.E.2d at 1035. The adjuster negotiated with State Farm, which offered to pay $75,062 on the claim. The insured owner refused the offer on the basis that it was unsatisfactory and thereafter retained an attorney who eventually negotiated a settlement in the amount of $137,976 in partial payment on the claim.\nThe public insurance adjuster then placed a lien on the owner’s recovery, preventing the owner from endorsing the draft. Litigation ensued. Ultimately, the trial court refused to remove the lien and ordered the owner to pay $15,412, the total amount of the adjuster’s lien. Heritage/Pullman Bank &amp; Trust Co., 104 Ill. App. 3d at 1059, 433 N.E.2d at 1035. Our colleagues in the First District remanded on the issue of the sufficiency of the public adjuster’s work but never disputed the validity of the lien, specifically stating as follows:\n“Where parties by their own contract create a duty, they must abide by the contract and make the promise good. [Citation.] We hold that the second amended complaint states a cause of action because it alleges that [the public insurance adjuster] never performed the services which entitled it to compensation. If this allegation could be proved, then plaintiffs would be entitled to the relief prayed for in their petition.” Heritage/Pullman Bank &amp; Trust Co., 104 Ill. App. 3d at 1060, 433 N.E.2d at 1035-36.\nIn the instant case, Clayton agreed to pay 10% of the amount of the agreed-upon loss to plaintiff for assisting in the adjustment of Clayton’s claim, thereby creating a common law hen that must be paid.\nState Farm’s assertion that it was not a party to the contract between plaintiff and Clayton and cannot be bound by any provision thereunder is unconvincing. Public insurance adjusters commonly assert liens on insurance proceeds that are honored by insurance companies. See Lake Shore Racquet Club, Inc. v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Cos., 91 Ill. App. 3d 1118, 415 N.E.2d 625 (1980). Here, plaintiff performed the work and negotiated a settlement with State Farm. Plaintiff is entitled to be compensated for its work per the terms of its contract with Clayton. State Farm initially issued a check to plaintiff but later followed Clayton’s instructions not to pay plaintiff. State Farm was wrong to go along with Clayton’s plan to deprive plaintiff of its rightfully earned fee.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court of St. Clair County is hereby affirmed.\nAffirmed.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

(West 2002)), seeking benefits from employer, United Airlines. At arbitration, the parties stipulated that claimant sustained accidental injuries that arose out of and in the course of her employment on May 9 and October 23, 2001. The only disputed issue was the nature and extent of her injuries. Following a consolidated hearing, the arbitrator awarded claimant wage differential benefits pursuant to section 8(d)(1) of the Act (820 ILCS 305/8(d)(1) (West 2002)) of (1) $417.93 per week for 13 weeks from May 13, 2005, through August 11, 2005; (2) $407.93 per week for 95/7 weeks from August 12, 2005, through May 8, 2007; and (3) $407.93 from May 9, 2007 and “continuing for the duration of the disability.”\nThe Illinois Workers’ Compensation Commission (Commission) affirmed and adopted the arbitrator’s decision. On judicial review, the circuit court of Cook County confirmed the Commission. Employer appeals, arguing (1) the word “disability” as used in section 8(d)(1) of the Act encompasses economic disability and (2) the Commission erred by sustaining claimant’s objection to evidence offered by employer regarding claimant’s work-life expectancy. We affirm.\nOn August 26, 1990, claimant began working for employer as a flight attendant. Employer agrees she sustained accidental injuries to her back that arose out of and in the course of her employment on both May 9, 2001, and October 23, 2001. Following her work-related accidents, claimant underwent extensive medical treatment, including two surgeries to her lower back. Ultimately, claimant’s treating physician placed her under permanent restrictions of no lifting of greater than 30 pounds, no pushing or pulling of greater than 40 pounds, and no repetitive bending or twisting. Employer’s medical department also determined long-term restrictions on claimant’s physical activities to be appropriate.\nAt arbitration, claimant sought wage differential benefits pursuant to section 8(d)(1) of the Act (820 ILCS 305/8(d)(1) (West 2002)). Employer attempted to introduce the testimony and a report of Dr. Arthur Eubanks, an economist, to provide an opinion on what age claimant was likely to leave the workforce. Claimant objected to Dr. Eubanks’s testimony and report, arguing it was irrelevant in a section 8(d)(1) proceeding. Employer argued the word “disability” in section 8(d)(1) referred to “economic disability” and evidence as to when claimant was likely to leave the workforce would be relevant to determining when her “economic disability” would end. The arbitrator disagreed with employer and sustained claimant’s objection to the evidence.\nOn April 8, 2009, the Commission affirmed and adopted the arbitrator’s decision without further comment. On September 24, 2009, the circuit court of Cook County confirmed the Commission.\nThis appeal followed.\nOn appeal, employer argues the Commission erred by sustaining claimant’s objection to the opinion evidence of its economist, Dr. Eu-banks, regarding the age at which claimant would retire from the workforce. It contends the clause “duration of disability” in section 8(d)(1) of the Act refers to the duration of a claimant’s impaired earning capacity and Dr. Eubanks’s opinions were relevant to a calculation of benefits under section 8(d)(1).\n“Evidentiary rulings made during the course of a workers’ compensation case will not be disturbed on review absent an abuse of discretion.” Certified Testing v. Industrial Comm’n, 367 Ill. App. 3d 938, 947, 856 N.E.2d 602, 610 (2006). However, issues involving statu tory construction are subject to de novo review. Washington District 50 Schools v. Illinois Workers’ Compensation Comm’n, 394 Ill. App. 3d 1087, 1090, 917 N.E.2d 586, 589 (2009).\n“The fundamental rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the legislature’s intent.” Beelman Trucking v. Illinois Workers’ Compensation Comm’n, 233 Ill. 2d 364, 370, 909 N.E.2d 818, 822 (2009). The best indication of legislative intent is the statutory language, given its plain and ordinary meaning. Beelman Trucking, 233 Ill. 2d at 370-71, 909 N.E.2d at 822. Other considerations include “the reason for the law, the problems to be remedied, and the objects and purposes sought.” Beelman Trucking, 233 Ill. 2d at 371, 909 N.E.2d at 822-23. “[T]he *** Act is a remedial statute intended to provide financial protection for injured workers and it is to be liberally construed to accomplish that objective.” Beelman Trucking, 233 Ill. 2d at 371, 909 N.E.2d at 823.\nSection 8(d)(1) of the Act provides as follows:\n“If, after the accidental injury has been sustained, the employee as a result thereof becomes partially incapacitated from pursuing his usual and customary line of employment, he shall *** receive compensation for the duration of his disability, subject to the limitations as to maximum amounts fixed in paragraph (b) of this Section, equal to 66⅔% of the difference between the average amount which he would be able to earn in the full performance of his duties in the occupation in which he was engaged at the time of the accident and the average amount which he is earning or is able to earn in some suitable employment or business after the accident.” (Emphasis added.) 820 ILCS 305/8(d)(1) (West 2002).\nHere the parties dispute the meaning of “disability” as used in section 8(d)(1). Claimant contends “disability” refers only to physical or mental disability, while employer maintains it also encompasses economic disability. The arbitrator and Commission rejected employer’s interpretation, relying on Petrie v. Industrial Comm’n, 160 Ill. App. 3d 165, 513 N.E.2d 104 (1987).\nIn Petrie, 160 Ill. App. 3d at 170, 513 N.E.2d at 108, this court considered “whether an increase in economic disability alone [was] a proper basis for modification of an award pursuant to section 19(h) of the Act.” We concluded “that a change in physical or mental condition is a prerequisite for a section 19(h) petition.” Petrie, 160 Ill. App. 3d at 172, 513 N.E.2d at 109. A review of the Act showed “that when the legislature used the term ‘disability’ in section 19(h) it was referring to physical and mental disability and not economic disability.” Petrie, 160 Ill. App. 3d at 171, 513 N.E.2d at 108.\n“This intent is evident by reference to the following sections: section 1(b)(3) refers to an employee’s ‘cause of action by reason of any injury, disablement or death’; section 8(d)(1) states that an injured employee who ‘becomes partially incapacitated from pursuing his usual and customary line of employment *** shall *** receive compensation for the duration of his disability’; section 8(d)(2) refers to injuries which ‘disable [the employee] from pursuing other suitable occupations’; and section 12 provides that an injured employee must submit to a physical examination on request of the employer for the purpose of determining the nature, extent, and duration of the injury and for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation due ‘for disability.’ [Citation.] On the other hand, when the legislature intended to refer to something other than physical and mental disability, it used different or additional language: sections 6(c)(1) and 8(h—1) refer to ‘legal disability’; and section 8(d)(2) refers to ‘impairment of earning capacity.’ [Citation.]” Petrie, 160 Ill. App. 3d at 171-72, 513 N.E.2d at 108-09.\nThis court relied on Petrie in Cassens Transport Co. v. Illinois Industrial Comm’n, 354 Ill. App. 3d 807, 821 N.E.2d 1274 (2005), when specifically addressing whether “disability” as used in section 8(d)(1) meant economic disability. In that case, the employer filed a motion to suspend wage differential benefits that were previously awarded to the claimant, asserting the claimant “had failed to respond to requests to provide income tax returns to determine whether a wage loss still existed.” Cassens, 354 Ill. App. 3d at 807, 821 N.E.2d at 1275. The Commission denied the motion, finding section 8(d)(1) did not refer to economic disability, only physical and mental disability. Cassens, 354 Ill. App. 3d at 807-08, 821 N.E.2d at 1275. “As there was no allegation that there was a change in [the] claimant’s physical condition, the Commission found there was no basis for suspending payments.” Cassens, 354 Ill. App. 3d at 808, 821 N.E.2d at 1275.\nOn review, we determined that neither the Commission nor this court had jurisdiction in the case, stating section 8(d)(1) was not one of the select provisions of the Act that permitted the Commission to reopen or modify a final decision. Cassens, 354 Ill. App. 3d at 811, 821 N.E.2d at 1278. However, we also stated there was “no reason to limit the interpretation of ‘disability’ in Petrie to section 19(h)” and found the word had “the same definition for purposes of review of wage differential benefits under section 8(d)(1).” Cassens, 354 Ill. App. 3d at 810, 821 N.E.2d at 1277.\nIn Cassens, the supreme court granted the employer’s petition for leave to appeal and affirmed this court’s ultimate decision in the case. Cassens Transport Co. v. Industrial Comm’n, 218 Ill. 2d 519, 533, 844 N.E.2d 414, 423 (2006). It agreed that the Commission lacked jurisdiction to modify the claimant’s section 8(d)(1) award. Cassens, 218 Ill. 2d at 533, 844 N.E.2d at 423. However, the court determined it was unnecessary to address the employer’s arguments as to the definition of “disability” in section 8(d)(1) and found this court’s discussion of that issue was improper. Cassens, 218 Ill. 2d at 533, 844 N.E.2d at 423-24.\nIn rendering its decision, the supreme court held the duration clause of section 8(d)(1) “is meaningful to the Commission’s initial determination of the proper award in any section 8(d)(1) case.” Cassens, 218 Ill. 2d at 529, 844 N.E.2d at 422. “By its plain language, [section 8(d)(1)] allows arbitrators and the Commission the option of determining that a claimant’s disability is likely to end, abate, or increase after a certain duration, and awarding compensation accordingly.” Cassens, 218 Ill. 2d at 529, 844 N.E.2d at 422. Further, “the Act establishes that employees and employers alike must use the opportunity of their initial hearing to present evidence showing the likely duration of an injury and its effect on the claimant’s earning capacity.” Cassens, 218 Ill. 2d at 530, 844 N.E.2d at 422.\nThe supreme court noted that to obtain benefits under section 8(d)(1), the claimant “must prove (1) that he or she is partially incapacitated from pursuing his or her usual and customary line of employment and (2) that he or she has suffered an impairment in the wages he or she earns or is able to earn.” Cassens, 218 Ill. 2d at 531, 844 N.E.2d at 422. The second prong of the section 8(d)(1) inquiry “focuses on earning capacity, rather than the dollar amount of an employee’s take-home pay.” Cassens, 218 Ill. 2d at 531, 844 N.E.2d at 422.\nEmployer argues the supreme court’s analysis in Cassens supports its position. Citing various portions of the court’s decision, it contends that the court “made clear” that the reference to “disability” in section 8(d)(1) “addresses the physical/mental, as well as economic components of ‘disability’ for purposes of compensating the impairment of long-term earning capacity caused by the work injury.”\nEmployer confuses the court’s analysis of section 8(d)(1) as a whole with analysis of the phrase “duration of disability” or simply the word “disability.” A discussion of section 8(d)(1) necessarily encompasses economic factors because its purpose is to compensate an injured employee for his reduced earning capacity. It does not follow that the specific phrase “duration of disability” within section 8(d)(1) must refer to economic disability rather than the duration of a claimant’s physical or mental injury. As stated, the court expressly declined to address the issue of the definition of “disability” as used in section 8(d)(1). A clear reading of Cassens shows it does not stand for the proposition employer suggests.\nAdditionally, this court has previously rejected the argument that a wage differential award should end at the age of retirement. In Fritz Electric Co. v. Industrial Comm’n, 165 Ill. App. 3d 550, 561, 518 N.E.2d 1289, 1296 (1988), the employer argued the Commission erred by not limiting its wage differential award to when the claimant turned 65, “implying that such loss could be a lifelong award long after [the claimant’s] earning capacity would abate from retirement or nonrelated illness.” We noted the employer “cited no cases requiring an interpretation of th[e] statutory language [‘for the duration of his disability’] other than its plain, ordinary meaning” and we declined to read any such requirement into the Act. Fritz, 165 Ill. App. 3d at 561, 518 N.E.2d at 1296.\nThe definition of “disability” announced in Petrie also applies to the definition of the word as used in section 8(d)(1) of the Act. The supreme court’s decision in Cassens did not address this issue and does not alter the holding in Petrie. The Commission did not err by finding economic disability was not encompassed within the word “disability” as used in section 8(d)(1).\nThe Commission also committed no error by sustaining claimant’s objection to the evidence offered by employer regarding claimant’s work-life expectancy. Employer sought to admit testimony and a report from Dr. Eubanks, an economist, who opined claimant’s “age at the time she is expected to exit the work force is within a range of age 58.27 to age 67.00 with a mid-point of age 62.64.” His opinions were based on her gender, age, educational attainment level, status in the work force, trial date, and the Skoog and Ciecka work-life expectancy model.\nNot only are Dr. Eubanks’s opinions speculative, they are also irrelevant to a determination of wage differential benefits. As discussed, the word “disability” in section 8(d)(1) does not refer to economic disability and employer’s proffered evidence is not relevant to determining the “duration of [claimant’s] disability.” The opinion evidence also adds nothing to other wage-differential considerations such as claimant’s incapacitation from employment or the impairment in the wages she earned or was able to earn. The Commission committed no error.\nFor the reasons stated, we affirm the circuit court’s judgment, confirming the Commission.\nAffirmed.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

Within 10 years of the date of the defendant’s last payment on the loan, plaintiff filed suit in the circuit court of Cook County alleging the “memo” to be a promissory note and seeking judgment for the outstanding principal and interest. The trial court found in favor of plaintiff and against defendant, entering final judgment in the amount of $81,344.12 plus interest. Defendant then filed this appeal, claiming that plaintiffs complaint was time barred under any of three applicable statutes of limitations (810 ILCS 5/3—118(g) (West 2008); 735 ILCS 5/13—205, 13—206 (West 2008)). For the following reasons, we affirm.\nJURISDICTION\nThe trial court entered a final judgment in the instant case on January 27, 2009, and defendant filed his notice of appeal on February 26, 2009. Accordingly, this court has jurisdiction pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rules 301 and 303 governing appeals from final judgments entered below. Ill. S. Ct. R. 301 (eff. Feb. 1, 1994); Ill. S. Ct. R. 303 (eff. May 30, 2008).\nBACKGROUND\nOn March 10, 1997, plaintiff Leonard Kranzler loaned defendant Lewis Saltzman $100,000. Defendant signed a typewritten “memo” on that same date that read as follows:\n“Memo to: Leonard Kranzler\nMarch 10, 1997\nLoaned to Lewis Saltzman $100,000 to be paid back with interest.\n/s/ Lewis Saltzman”\nBetween November 30, 1999, and July 5, 2005, plaintiff received intermittent payments on the debt totaling $74,500. The payments ceased after July 5, 2005, and on June 29, 2007, plaintiff filed a complaint in the circuit court seeking judgment for the outstanding principal due on the loan along with interest accumulated to date. On November 14, 2007, plaintiff filed an amended complaint that stated the same allegations as the first complaint and added a calculation showing that the sum of the outstanding principal balance on the “promissory note,” plus all interest due and owing, totaled $160,241.38 as of October 31, 2007.\nWhen defendant failed to respond to plaintiffs amended complaint, plaintiff sought entry of a default judgment against defendant, which the trial court entered in favor of plaintiff on January 16, 2008, in the amount of $113,692.14. Defendant moved to vacate the default judgment within 30 days of the entry of default, and the trial court granted defendant’s motion to vacate on March 13, 2008.\nOn the same date, defendant moved for a judgment on the pleadings pursuant to section 2—615(e) of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2—615(e) (West 2008)), alleging that plaintiff’s action was time barred by the statute of limitations provided by article III of the Uniform Commercial Code (810 ILCS 5/3—101 et seq. (West 2008)) as well as the 10-year statute of limitations for written contracts under section 13—206 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/13—206 (West 2008)). The trial court denied defendant’s motion on May 1, 2008, and allowed plaintiff to file a second amended complaint.\nPlaintiff filed his second amended complaint on May 1, 2008. It reiterated plaintiffs allegations in the two preceding complaints and enumerated 15 separate payments that were made on the loan between November 30, 1999, and July 5, 2005. Exhibit B to plaintiffs second amended complaint included excerpts from a deposition taken of defendant in an unrelated matter in which defendant admitted that plaintiff had loaned him $100,000 and that he had requested that his company, Saltzman Printers, Inc. (SPI), make payments on the loan. In his answers to plaintiff’s second amended complaint, defendant admitted that the 15 enumerated payments were made on the loan. In addition, in his response to plaintiff’s first request for admissions, defendant admitted that he was president, director, and shareholder of SPI and that he had directed SPI to make the 15 payments to plaintiff in partial repayment of the loan.\nOn September 24, 2008, plaintiff moved for summary judgment, alleging that defendant owed him $115,797.65 plus per diem interest. The trial court entered partial summary judgment on the issue of liability in favor of plaintiff on December 5, 2008, and set a hearing to determine the amount of interest owed.\nOn January 27, 2009, the trial court entered a judgment against defendant and in favor of plaintiff in the amount of $81,344.12. The decision also called for postjudgment interest to accrue at the rate of 9% per annum. Defendant then filed this timely appeal.\nANALYSIS\nDefendant appeals from the trial court’s judgment in favor of plaintiff and contends that the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss plaintiffs second amended complaint. We are not persuaded that the trial court erred.\nFirst, we have considered which statute of limitations applies in the instant case. The parties point to three different statutes of limitations in their briefs: 3 years for actions arising under article III of the Uniform Commercial Code (810 ILCS 5/3—118(g) (West 2008)), 5 years for actions on unwritten contracts and “all civil actions not otherwise provided for” (735 ILCS 5/13—205 (West 2008)), and 10 years for written contracts or “other evidences of indebtedness in writing” (735 ILCS 5/13—206 (West 2008)). The parties agreed during oral argument that the article III statute of limitations cannot apply because the document at issue here does not meet the requirements of a negotiable instrument. Defendant contends that the document was not a written contract and thus falls under the five-year statute of limitations for unwritten contracts. 735 ILCS 5/13—205 (West 2008). Plaintiff responds that the instrument contains all essential terms of a promise to pay and thus qualifies for the 10-year statute of limitations under section 13—206 (735 ILCS 5/13—206 (West 2008)). Which statute of limitations applies is a question of law that we review de novo. Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Bowman, 229 Ill. 2d 461, 466 (2008).\nWe must first determine whether the document is merely a partial writing evidencing an oral agreement or a complete writing containing all essential terms. Where the writings attached to the complaint do not contain the essential terms of the contract, even if the essential terms may be easily ascertained elsewhere, the contract is not written but oral. Clark v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 141 Ill. App. 3d 174, 176 (1986). But a writing is complete “when the language of the instrument may fairly be construed to contain a promise to pay money or contains facts from which the law implies a promise to pay, so long as parol evidence is not necessary to establish any essential elements.” Toth v. Mansell, 207 Ill. App. 3d 665, 670 (1990) (finding that invoices, monthly statements, and ledgers did not constitute “ ‘other evidence of indebtedness’ ” because they could not establish the essential element of a promise to pay). When that writing is not simply a contract but also a promise to pay, then the writing constitutes “ ‘other evidence of indebtedness’ ” for the purposes of section 13—206 of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure. Toth, 207 Ill. App. 3d at 670; In re Estate of Garrett, 24 Ill. App. 3d 895, 899 (1975) (“If the language of a writing may fairly be construed to contain a promise to pay money, or if the instrument states a fact from which the law implies an obligation to pay and there is no need to resort to parol evidence in order to establish any essential elements of the agreement forming the basis of the action, the instrument is within [section 13—206 (735 ILCS 5/13—206 (West 2008))] founded upon ‘evidences of indebtedness in writing.’ ”); see also Portfolio Acquisitions, L.L.C. v. Feltman, 391 Ill. App. 3d 642, 652 (2009) (determining that a credit card contract was oral because the plaintiff debt collection agency did not present as evidence a copy of the cardholder agreement between defendant and the issuing bank of the credit card, and thus, parol evidence was necessary to show the essential terms and conditions of that contract as well as the relationship between the parties and the defendant’s receipt and acceptance of those essential terms); Held v. Held, 137 F.3d 998, 1000 (7th Cir. 1998) (finding that a written letter submitted as evidence of an express trust was not “other evidence of indebtedness” because it did not contain all of the essential elements of a trust agreement).\n•1 The essential elements or terms of a promise to pay are: (1) the parties to the agreement, (2) the nature of the transaction, (3) the amount in question, and (4) at least a reasonable implication of an intention to repay the debt. In re Estate of Garrett, 24 Ill. App. 3d at 898. In Garrett, the Second District considered an instrument similar to the one at issue here. There the parties disputed whether a handwritten note discovered in the decedent’s safety deposit box constituted written evidence of an oral contract or “ ‘other evidence of indebtedness.’ ” Garrett, 24 Ill. App. 3d at 897. One side of the piece of paper showed a paid promissory note in the amount of $5,000 and the other side held the handwritten note indicating that the claimant and a third person had lent decedent the funds to pay the promissory note and that decedent wished to repay the two men out of his estate. Id. The envelope containing this piece of paper also bore a note in the decedent’s handwriting indicating that he owed the claimant and the third party each $2,500. Id. On appeal, the court concluded that the notes did not constitute a written contract because they lacked mutuality; there was no evidence that the claimant had known of their existence prior to the death of the decedent. Id. at 898.\n•2 However, the Garrett court found that “being of a contractual nature, the writings do constitute ‘other evidences of indebtedness in writing.’ ” Id. The court reasoned:\n“Whether an action is based on a written contract or on any other evidence of indebtedness in writing, the action must be upon the writing and it is not enought [sic] that the evidence by which the cause of action is supported is in writing. [Citations.]\nThe writings before us are not, however, mere evidence of a previous oral agreement. They are by themselves complete, thus eliminating the necessity of resort to parol evidence. The parties to the agreement, the nature of the transaction, the amount in question and, at least by reasonable implication, an intention to repay the debt are indicated therein. Accordingly, the writings come within the purview of [section 13—206 (735 ILCS 5/13—206 (West 2008))].” Garrett, 24 Ill. App. 3d at 898.\nThus, a written instrument evidencing a promise to pay qualifies as “other evidence of indebtedness in writing” for purposes of the 10-year statute of limitations so long as the writing contains all essential terms of a promise to pay. Id.\n•3 As in Garrett, the instrument at the heart of the dispute in the instant case contains all of the essential elements of a promise to pay. First, the instrument names the parties to the agreement: plaintiff and defendant. Second, it clearly establishes the nature of the transaction. Plaintiff loaned money to defendant. Third, the amount in question is readily apparent: $100,000 plus interest. Finally, the instrument contains evidence of the debtor’s intent to repay the loan. The instrument reads “to be paid back with interest” and is signed by defendant, the debtor. At the very least, this is a reasonable implication of defendant’s intent to repay the loan. See id.\nDefendant contends that because the rate of interest is not specified in the instrument, parol evidence is required to establish the amount in question and thus the document does not contain all es sential terms. However, defendant cites to no cases in support of this argument and we have not found any that would bolster his position. In addition, defendant contends that it is unclear from the face of the instrument exactly whom he should repay. This is a spurious argument when the instrument clearly states the person who loaned defendant the money, and defendant has not cited to any case law holding otherwise. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 341(h)(7) (eff. July 1, 2008); Dillon v. Evanston Hospital, 199 Ill. 2d 483, 493 (2002) (“ ‘A court of review is entitled to have the issues clearly defined and to be cited pertinent authority. A point not argued or supported by citation to relevant authority fails to satisfy the requirements of Rule 341([h])(7).’ ”).\nAccordingly, we find that the instrument presented here constitutes “other evidence of indebtedness in writing” and thus falls within the purview of the 10-year statute of limitations in section 13—206 of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure.\n•4 Now we must consider when that 10-year statute of limitations began to run in order to discern whether the instant action was timely filed. Defendant contends that the statute of limitations began to run the first day after the loan was made. Plaintiff argues, on the other hand, that the statute of limitations began to run on the date of the last payment made on the debt, and we find plaintiff’s argument persuasive here.\nDefendant cites to Kozasa v. Guardian Electric Manufacturing Co., 99 Ill. App. 3d 669 (1981), for the proposition that “[a] cause of action accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run when a creditor may legally demand payment from a debtor.” Kozasa, 99 Ill. App. 3d at 673. However, Kozasa does not hold that the statute of limitations begins to run the first day after a debtor makes a promise to pay, as defendant argues. Rather, the court found that when a debtor has been making payments on a debt, the statute of limitations begins to run, not when the debtor threatens to stop making payments under the contract, but instead when the next payment becomes due and remains unpaid. Id. In Kozasa the plaintiff had designed a relay used in electrical products and orally contracted with the defendant, an electronics component manufacturer, to arrange for an overseas supplier to manufacture the relays. Id. at 670-71. The parties entered into their oral agreement on November 16, 1967, and during December 1969 and January 1970 the defendant unilaterally attempted to alter the terms of the deal, culminating with sending the plaintiff a “ ‘final check *** under the old arrangement’ ” on January 19, 1970. Id. at 672. During this time, the defendant had been making periodic payments to the plaintiff under their oral agreement and only ceased this practice when it failed to make the scheduled February payment. Id. at 674. The court found that no breach of the contract occurred until defendant failed to make that scheduled payment and thus the statute of limitations began to run from the time of the breach, which was the first time that the plaintiff could legally demand payment from the defendant. Id.\nMoreover, defendant’s argument ignores the language of the applicable statute of limitations. As noted, section 13—206 states, “actions on *** other evidences of indebtedness in writing *** shall be commenced within 10 years next after the cause of action accrued; but if any payment or new promise to pay has been made, in writing, on any *** other written evidence of indebtedness, within or after the period of 10 years, then an action may be commenced thereon at any time within 10 years after the time of such payment or promise to pay.” (Emphasis added.) 735 ILCS 5/13—206 (West 2008). Accordingly, when payments have been made on a debt instrument that qualifies as “other evidence of indebtedness in writing” under section 13—206, the statute of limitations begins to run from the date of the last payment made, even if 10 years had already run on the statute of limitations by the time of the last payment. See Krajcir v. Egidi, 305 Ill. App. 3d 613, 622 (1999) (finding that a plaintiff who filed his complaint within 10 years of the last payment made on a nonnegotiable promissory note had timely filed).\nIn the instant case, defendant signed the instrument on March 10, 1997, but plaintiff did not file his complaint until June 29, 2007. However, plaintiffs second amended complaint alleges that 15 payments were made on the instrument between July 1, 1997, and July 5, 2005. Although defendant denies in his briefs on appeal that he ever made such payments or caused them to be made, he admitted in his response to plaintiffs first request for admissions that during his tenure as president, director, and shareholder of SPI he caused SPI to make 15 payments on the instrument between November 30, 1999, and September 26, 2003. Any one of these payments would have been sufficient to trigger a new 10-year limitations period under section 13—206 and thus we find that plaintiffs complaint was timely filed.\nCONCLUSION\nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the circuit court of Cook County.\nAffirmed.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

This matter was litigated in the chancery division of the circuit court of Cook County for more than eight years and appellants-intervenors’ cause of action was dismissed in two separate orders entered in 2005 and 2009, both times for a lack of standing. On appeal, appellants contend that both counts of their complaint were improperly dismissed. For the reasons discussed at length below, we reverse and remand.\nI. BACKGROUND\nThe partnerships in question were formed by various persons who were employed in a Chicago real estate development firm. Appellants, intervening plaintiffs (intervenors) below, were limited partners in two Illinois limited partnerships: I.B.E Limited Partnership (IBP) and TB Limited Partnership (TB), of which Dennis J. Hiffman, John E. Shaffer, E. Thomas Collins, Jr., Daniel G. Anderson, and Richard E. Hulina (defendants) were the general partners in one or both of the partnerships. Defendants were principals in HSA Commercial Real Estate, Inc. (HSA), in the early 1990s, with intervenors then being either employees or contractors of HSA.\nThe first involved partnership, IBP was formed by defendants in January 1992 for the purpose of developing a shopping center in Bed-ford Park, Illinois. Various employees and contractors of HSA were offered the opportunity to become limited partners of IBP in exchange for a nominal capital contribution of $10 per 1% of ownership. Intervenors Mark Munaretto and William Skrzelowski each became a 0.5% limited partner in this entity. The second partnership, TB, was formed in May 1993 by Hiffman, Shaffer, Collins and Hulina, for the purposes of acquiring and developing property in Broadview, Illinois. Again, employees and contractors were offered the opportunity to buy into the partnership as limited partners for $10 per 1% of ownership. In July 1993, intervenors John Girsch, Edward Zifkin, and Mark Wheeles each became 0.5% limited partners, and Munaretto became a 0.75% limited partner.\nSimply stated, the two projects undertaken by IBP and TB involved substantial real estate redevelopment. The general partners planned to utilize TIE bonds issued by the respective municipalities involved in the projects. TIE bonds are financial instruments issued by municipalities to assist in the funding of redevelopment projects in designated areas. See 65 ILCS 5/11—74.4 et seq. (West 2008). The principal and interest on TIE bonds are paid from the increase in real estate taxes, and sales taxes in certain cases, that is anticipated to occur from a successful redevelopment project. IBP and TB entered into separate redevelopment agreements with the Villages of Bedford Park and Broadview, and pursuant to the agreements, each village issued senior lien TIE bonds (Senior Bonds) to the partnerships. Bedford Park issued $10.5 million in Senior Bonds and Broadview issued $23 million, with William Blair &amp; Company and Dain Bosworth acting as the respective underwriters.\nIn addition to the Senior Bonds, the two villages agreed to issue TIE bonds subordinate to the Senior Bonds. Bedford Park issued “Developer Bonds” with a face value of $7 million and Broadview issued “Junior Bonds” in the amount of $8 million. Because the Developer and Junior Bonds were subordinate to the Senior Bonds, principal and interest would only be paid to the holders in the event that the incremental tax revenues exceeded the amounts required to satisfy all the principal and interest payments of the Senior Bonds. One of the general partners, E. Thomas Collins, Jr., stated in a sworn affidavit and a deposition that it was discussed and understood between the limited and general partners that the subordinate bonds would be taken by the general partners due to the personal investments they had made in creating the projects. Interveners, on the other hand, deny being notified that the general partners would acquire the Junior or Development Bonds for themselves and the partnership agreements themselves were silent on the subject.\nIn any event, the Developer Bonds were issued in June 1992 to IBE which were then purchased by the general partners of IBP for $550,000, netting the partners $5,500 per percentage point of interest. The purchase was disclosed to the limited partners in a June 11, 1992, letter, which also enclosed checks payable in appropriate amounts to each partner. The purchase price was based on a draft valuation letter by Charles Freeburg of William Blair &amp; Company. In a separate transaction, the Junior Bonds were issued directly to the general partners of TB around September 1994. The issuance was treated as a distribution against their partnership capital accounts, which were reduced by the face amount of the Junior Bonds.\nIn the several years subsequent to the bond transactions, the redevelopment projects eventually became successful, and as a result, tax revenues were generated in excess of the projects’ projections. Because of this, the Senior Bonds’ obligations were able to be fulfilled (with cash distributions being made to all partners) and the Developer and Junior Bonds, in turn, increased in value. The transactions revolving around the Developer and Junior Bonds, and other certain events outlined below, would eventually serve as the basis of interveners’ allegations of a breach of fiduciary duty by defendants.\nA. TB Partnership Events and Proceedings\nIn 1999, Broadview unexpectedly refinanced the Senior and Junior Bonds. New bonds with lower interest rates were issued, and pursuant to the redemption provision of the original Junior Bonds, Broadview paid defendants, as general partners of TB, $9 million in order to redeem the bonds. Up to that point, the general partners of TB were paid approximately $4.35 million in interest payments as well. In 2001, Melissa S. Pielet, individually and derivatively on behalf of IBP and TB, filed an action against the defendants, alleging that they breached their fiduciary duties to the partnerships by transferring the subordinated bonds to themselves for their own benefit. The parties subsequently engaged in discovery and motion practice for over a year. During that time, Broadview Village Center (the shopping mall owned and developed by TB) lost two large tenants. As a result, TB’s rental income fell short of its financial obligations and an action to foreclose was initiated against TB’s mortgage.\nTo avoid foreclosure, TB developed a complex plan to recapitalize and restructure its debts. A key component of the plan included plans to negotiate a contract with Wal-Mart where, among other things, it would purchase from TB a vacant building in the Broadview Village Center along with the underlying real estate. To implement the plan, however, it was determined that TB would require $5.5 million in cash, thus triggering a “capital call” under which the partners would all contribute funds in proportionate share to meet the financial needs of the partnership. In this particular agreement, the limited partners were not required to contribute, but it provided that any partner who declined to contribute would forfeit his or her partnership interest. The capital call in question was set to occur on September 30, 2003.\nAround the same time, the general partners proposed to settle Pielet’s action by making a $5.5 million loan to TB themselves in place of the capital call. In December 2003, Pielet withdrew as a plaintiff from the action she initiated and Keith Bank, another limited partner, then filed and was granted a motion for leave to intervene as party plaintiff. Shortly thereafter, however, intervenors averred that Mr. Bank was not representing the partnerships in their best interests. They then sought and obtained leave to intervene in this action in February 2004.\nIn March 2004, the circuit court ordered defendants to issue a notice of their proposed settlement to all partners of TB. The notice explained that under the proposed settlement, the capital call would be suspended and that no limited partner would forfeit an interest in TB by failing to contribute a proportionate share. The obligation to contribute, however, would be reinstated if the loan or settlement was terminated. Intervenors initiated proceedings objecting to the proposed settlement and requested the circuit court to disapprove it. Fairness hearings were conducted in May 2004 but before the circuit court could rule, defendants filed a notice withdrawing the proposed settlement, explaining that Wal-Mart had terminated its contract and would not be purchasing the building or real estate as anticipated, thwarting the original refinancing strategy. The $5.5 million capital call was reinstated, and each partner was notified that he or she had 30 days, or until July 30, 2004, to elect whether to contribute a proportionate share of the call pursuant to the agreement.\nOn the penultimate day before the effectiveness of the capital call, intervenors filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), seeking to prevent defendants from foreclosing their partnership interests in the event intervenors chose not to contribute to the capital call. The motion was denied after a lengthy and spirited argument in open court and intervenors were specifically notified by the trial court that if they did not contribute their proportionate share of the capital call, they “would be out of business.” Intervenors declined to contribute, which ineluctably led to a motion to dismiss the claims relating to TB, namely, count II of intervenors’ amended complaint, arguing that intervenors lacked standing to pursue their claims after forfeiting their interests. The circuit court granted the motion to dismiss in a written order on March 24, 2005. Intervenors filed a “Corrected Amended Complaint,” which defendants again moved to dismiss due to a lack of standing. The motion was granted on December 8, 2005, in one of the written orders from which intervenors appeal.\nB. IBP Partnership Events and Proceedings\nThe only intervenors who held interest in IBP were Skrzelowski and Munaretto. The IBP partnership agreement provided that the partnership could repurchase the interest of any limited partner who terminates his or her employment with the partnership or a related entity. Paragraph 17 of the IBP partnership agreement provides for a “Repurchase Option of the Partnership.” In the event that a limited partner terminated his employment with “the Partnership or any entity in which any Partner is affiliated,” the terminated partner “shall give written notice to the Partnership which shall state all details regarding such Repurchase Event.” The provision further provides that if the terminated partner fails to give notice of repurchase, the partnership itself may give such notice on behalf of the terminated partner “at any time thereafter.” At that point, the partnership has the option to acquire the partnership interest of the terminated partner.\nMunaretto and Skrzelowski left HSA in 1993 and 1994, respectively, but neither individual ever issued a repurchase notice as called for in the agreement. After another dispositive motion failed in the trial court, on April 17, 2009, IBP issued repurchase notices to Munaretto and Skrzelowski pursuant to the authorization in the IBP partnership agreement. Included with the notice was a repurchase agreement providing that their interests would be purchased by IBP according to a valuation provision within the IBP partnership agreement, which essentially provided that the difference between a limited partner’s initial investment and the amount of cash distributions received is the repurchase value. Although Munaretto and Skrzelowski did not execute and return their respective agreements, the IBP partnership agreement contained a power of attorney provision allowing the general partners to execute such a document on their behalf. On April 30, 2009, the agreements were accordingly executed by a general partner. After Munaretto’s and Skrezlowski’s interests were repurchased, defendants filed a motion to dismiss their claims for lack of standing. On August 13, 2009, the circuit court granted the motion in a written order. Intervenors now timely appeal.\nII. ANALYSIS\nA. Dismissal of Count II (TB)\nOn appeal, intervenors first contend that the circuit court improperly dismissed count II of their amended complaint. More specifically, they argue that they sufficiently alleged individual claims for restoration and thus count II should not have been dismissed for lack of standing. Count II alleged a breach of fiduciary duty regarding TB, concerning the transaction of the Junior Bonds to defendants. The circuit court’s written order stated that defendants sought to dismiss count II because the intervenors failed to state an individual claim. Having found that the intervenors were no longer members of the partnership involved in count II, the circuit court next found they no longer had standing to bring claims on behalf of the partnership. The order also noted that while plaintiffs “do now make a claim for restoration of their partnership interests, they allege no facts of individual harm that would entitle them to such restoration.”\nDefendants’ motion to dismiss was based upon sections 2—615 and 2—619 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) (735 ILCS 5/2—615, 2—619 (West 2008)). A motion to dismiss under section 2—615 admits all well-pleaded facts and attacks the legal sufficiency of the complaint. La Salle National Bank v. City Suites, Inc., 325 Ill. App. 3d 780, 790 (2001). A motion to dismiss under section 2—619, on the other hand, admits the legal sufficiency of the complaint but raises defects, defenses, or other affirmative matters that appear on the face of the complaint or are established by external submissions that act to defeat the claim. Krilich v. American National Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Chicago, 334 Ill. App. 3d 563, 569-70 (2002). We review an order granting a motion to dismiss pursuant to section 2—615 or section 2—619 de novo. Illinois Non-Profit Risk Management Ass’n v. Human Service Center of Southern Metro-East, 378 Ill. App. 3d 713, 719 (2008). Furthermore, when reviewing motions under either section 2—615 or 2—619, we accept all well-pleaded facts in the complaint as true and draw all reason able inferences from those facts in favor of the nonmoving party in order to determine whether a cause of action can be sustained. Dopkeen v. Whitaker, 399 Ill. App. 3d 682, 684 (2010).\nA partnership is a contractual relationship, and as such, contract law applies and a partnership is accordingly controlled by the terms of the agreement under which it is formed. Fisher v. Parks, 248 Ill. App. 3d 666, 674-75 (1993). If the written agreement is unambiguous, the court must construe the parties’ intent from the writing itself as a matter of law and effectuate its plain and ordinary meaning. Buenz v. Frontline Transportation Co., 227 Ill. 2d 302, 308 (2008). However, no language in an agreement, however clear and explicit, can reduce a partner’s fiduciary duty. See 1515 North Wells, L.P. v. 1513 North Wells, L.L.C., 392 Ill. App. 3d 863, 874 (2009). The existence of a fiduciary relationship between all partners is well established, and each partner is bound to exercise the utmost good faith and honesty in all matters relating to the partnership business. Winston &amp; Strawn v. Nosal, 279 Ill. App. 3d 231, 239-40 (1996). Illinois has held that this fiduciary duty “prohibits all forms of secret dealings and self-preference in any [partnership] matter” (Winston &amp; Strawn, 279 Ill. App. 3d at 239-40; see Bakalis v. Bressler, 1 Ill. 2d 72, 79 (1953); Labovitz v. Dolan, 189 Ill. App. 3d 403, 412 (1989)), and also “requires each partner to fully disclose partnership business to other partners” (Winston &amp; Strawn, 279 Ill. App. 3d at 240 (citing Borys v. Rudd, 207 Ill. App. 3d 610, 620 (1990))).\nWe initially note that the circuit court ruled after intervenors’ emergency TRO motion that the capital call issued by TB was “indeed authorized by the terms of the agreement” between the partners. This finding is not disputed on appeal. Intervenors did not contribute their required share of the capital call, and pursuant to the terms of TB’s partnership agreement, they forfeited any interest they had in the partnership. Subsequently, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of standing, which the circuit court granted.\nSuperficially, dismissal would appear proper based on the rules of standing because, generally, individuals cannot maintain a derivative action against a partnership if they have no interest in the partnership. See Caparos v. Morton, 364 Ill. App. 3d 159, 167-68 (2006); Lower v. Lanark Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 151 Ill. App. 3d 471, 473 (1986). Intervenors, however, point to Labovitz v. Dolan, 189 Ill. App. 3d 403 (1989), in support of their argument that their cause of action should not have been dismissed. In Labovitz, the plaintiffs were former limited partners in a partnership with the defendant general partner who had sole management discretion pursuant to the underlying partnership agreement. The partnership incurred significant tax obligations but the general partner withheld cash distributions that would have covered plaintiffs’ associated pro rata share. Plaintiffs sold their partnership interests to the general partner at a “bargain price” due to the economic burden but subsequently filed a complaint against the general partner for breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiffs’ complaint was dismissed by the circuit court, which held that the general partner’s acts were within the broad discretion granted to him by the partnership agreement. On appeal, this court reversed and remanded, holding that a general partner’s broad discretion in the cash distributions of the partnership does not trump, but instead exists concurrently with, the general partner’s fiduciary duty owed to the limited partners in dealing with them and the assets of the partnership. Labovitz, 189 Ill. App. 3d at 412. Although Labovitz is, in a sense, factually dissimilar, we nevertheless find it to be substantively instructive.\nHere, intervenors’ complaint alleges that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by: (1) misappropriating the Junior Bonds; and (2) issuing a capital call that was only necessitated by their alleged misappropriation. While we are not bound to accept the complaint’s conclusory allegations, as noted above, we accept all well-pleaded facts in the complaint as true and will draw all reasonable inferences from those facts in favor of the nonmoving party in order to determine whether a cause of action can be sustained. Dopkeen, 399 Ill. App. 3d at 684. With this in mind, a close examination of the complaint and record raises a number of concerns regarding the defendants’ acts revolving around the transaction of the Junior Bonds. First, although Collins’ affidavit asserts that he and other general partners had somehow related to the intervenors that the Junior Bonds would be only for the benefit of the general partners, it is telling that the TB partnership agreement is completely silent on the issue. Second, the bond trustee for the Village of Broadview was apparently directed to issue the Junior Bonds directly to the general partners. This event is highly suspect given the language within the applicable redevelopment agreement between TB and the Village of Broadview indicating that any Junior Bonds issued would be delivered to and purchased by the “Developer,” which includes TB as a whole but not the general partners as a discrete entity. Third, from the record and complaint it appears that at the time of the Junior Bonds’ issuance, intervenors were unaware of the events surrounding the transaction of the Junior Bonds. Finally, we note that in apparent consideration for the Junior Bonds, the capital accounts of the general partners were reduced; however, the limited partners did not actually receive any cash distributions as a result of the Junior Bond transaction. The defendants, on the other hand, ultimately received over $13 million as a result of owning the Junior Bonds.\nFundamentally, we find the instant case to be analogous to Labovitz, where a general partner’s management discretion was used in breach of a fiduciary duty and created the loss of a limited partner’s interest through economic coercion. We reiterate that while we offer no opinion as to the merits of the underlying case, when we take intervenors’ well-pleaded facts as time and draw the reasonable inferences therefrom, the allegation remains that the general partners, through their management discretion and authority, obfuscated the personal taking of the Junior Bonds originally designated as partnership assets, which resulted in a financial windfall to them of over $13 million. The partnership then experienced a shortage of funds and the general partners imposed a financial obligation upon the intervenors, resulting in their loss of interests in TB. Permitting intervenors’ cause of action to be dismissed, and essentially validating their loss of interest, by pointing to management discretion and authority without consideration of the overarching principles of partnership fiduciary duties here would miss the forest for the trees. As Labovitz discussed in detail, “partners owe each other the duty to exercise the highest degree of honesty, fairness and good faith in their dealings with one another and in the handling of partnership assets,” also noting that a greater duty rests upon the general partners. Labovitz, 189 Ill. App. 3d at 408-09. The record casts defendants’ actions into doubt and to allow dismissal under these circumstances is contrary to the principles of partnership fiduciary duty established above, and we hold that the trial court erred in dismissing count II.\nB. Dismissal of Count I (IBP)\nIntervenors next contend that the circuit court improperly dismissed count I of their amended complaint. Count I of the amended complaint related to the Developer Bonds which were purchased by the general partners from IBP The circuit court dismissed count I in 2009 because intervenors Munaretto and Skrzelowski lacked standing to maintain the action after IBP repurchased their partnership interests pursuant to the partnership agreement. Because the circuit court dismissed the count under section 2—619 of the Code, we review this issue de novo. Illinois Non-Profit Risk Management Ass’n, 378 Ill. App. 3d at 719. On appeal, intervenors base their arguments for reversal on waiver, laches, and general principles of inequity. As a threshold matter, we observe that intervenors do not dispute that the repurchase of their interests were, as a technical matter, properly executed pursuant to the IBP partnership agreement or that their claim is a derivative action. Intervenors’ arguments regarding the repurchase option in the IBP partnership agreement are based upon waiver, laches, and equity.\nAs a threshold matter, we must find that waiver and laches provide little help to intervenors here. Waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right, and may be express or implied. Midwest Builder Distributing, Inc. v. Lord &amp; Essex, Inc., 383 Ill. App. 3d 645, 673 (2007). While implied waiver of a right can arise through conduct inconsistent with an intent to enforce that right, the party seeking waiver carries the burden of “proving a clear, unequivocal, and decisive act of its opponent manifesting an intention to waive its rights.” In re Nitz, 317 Ill. App. 3d 119, 130 (2000). As gleaned from the record and confirmed during oral arguments before this court, it is apparent that defendants were unaware of the repurchase option written into their own contract until shortly before exercising it. Given that waiver requires the party to be aware of the right, as it is an intentional relinquishment of a known right, we cannot say that defendants here technically waived the right to exercise the repurchase option clause.\nIntervenors’ argument revolving around laches suffers from a different, but equally fatal, legal infirmity. Generally, laches is an equitable doctrine precluding litigants from asserting a claim when prejudice occurs as a result of a litigant’s unreasonable delay in raising that claim. Madigan v. Yballe, 397 Ill. App. 3d 481, 493 (2009). The two fundamental elements of laches are (1) a lack of due diligence by the party asserting the claim; and (2) prejudice to the opposing party. Gersch v. Department of Professional Regulation, 308 Ill. App. 3d 649, 661 (1999). We have held that laches is an affirmative defense and, as such, is simply unavailable to a party that is not a defendant. Malatesta v. Mitsubishi Aircraft International, Inc., 275 Ill. App. 3d 370, 386 (1995); see Wolfram Partnership, Ltd. v. LaSalle National Bank, 328 Ill. App. 3d 207, 225 n.10 (2001) (noting that laches may be proper to bar defendants’ counterclaim but not to prevent defendants’ assertion of a forfeiture of a lease agreement through default). Although count I was dismissed based on a lack of standing through defendants’ motion, defendants have not raised any counterclaim to which intervenors are a defendant. Accordingly, we find the doctrine of laches to be inapplicable here.\nIntervenors lastly argue that it would be inequitable to allow defendants to exercise the repurchase option. Given the specific circumstances of the instant case, we are persuaded that they should prevail on this argument. Intervenors argue that a court of equity is duty-bound to examine substance rather than the form of a transaction (Reese v. Melahn, 53 Ill. 2d 508, 513 (1973)), and the maxim that “equity considers that as done which ought to be done” (Cesena v. Du Page County, 145 Ill. 2d 32, 38 (1991)). Along with these general principles, we reiterate that the fiduciary duties discussed above relat ing to TB’s partners exist with equal strength here among IBP’s partners as well. Furthermore, we have held that “ ‘[a] convenant of good faith and fair dealing is implicit in every contract as a matter of law.’ ” Horwitz v. Sonnenschein Nath &amp; Rosenthal, LLP, 399 Ill. App. 3d 965, 978 (2010) (quoting Franz v. Calaco Development Corp., 352 Ill. App. 3d 1129, 1152 (2004)). A reason this convenant is implied is to protect the parties such that no party takes advantage of another “in a way that could not have been contemplated at the time the contract was drafted.” Gore v. Indiana Insurance Co., 376 Ill. App. 3d 282, 286 (2007). Disputes involving the exercise of good faith generally arise when one party is given broad discretion in performing its obligations under the contract, and therefore “[t]he duty of good faith and fair dealing is a limitation on the exercise of that discretion, requiring the party vested with discretion to exercise it reasonably and with proper motive, not arbitrarily, capriciously, or in a manner inconsistent with the parties’ reasonable expectations.” Gore, 376 Ill. App. 3d at 286.\nAccording to a sworn declaration by John E. Shaffer, the purpose in offering partnership interests to Munaretto and Skrzelowski was to motivate them as HSA employees. Should they somehow sever their associations with HSA, Shaffer stated that there would be no relevance in motivating them as an HSA employee and the repurchase clause within the IBP partnership agreement served as the vehicle to buy back their interests. An examination of the underlying proceedings, however, indicates that the exercise of the repurchase option could have been effected when Munaretto and Skrzelowski left HSA in the early 1990s. Despite this, defendants participated in the subsequent litigation for more than eight years. In 2009, after having a different dispositive motion fail before the trial court, defendants appeared to adjust their strategy. As stated during oral arguments before us, after a careful rereading of the IBP partnership agreement, defendants decided to exercise the repurchase option and shortly thereafter filed a motion to dismiss intervenors’ claims for a lack of standing. The motivation behind the exercise of that right was not to buy back interests of limited partners no longer associated with HSA, but primarily to simply remove intervenors’ standing. Doing so is an exercise of discretion that was utilized in a manner inconsistent with the parties’ reasonable expectations. While we acknowledge that repurchase options may legitimately serve a variety of purposes, they cannot operate to remove a party’s standing under circumstances like those in the case sub judice. Accordingly, count I was improperly dismissed and we reverse.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court of Cook County and remand for further proceedings.\nReversed and remanded.\nThe underlying litigation was initially commenced by Melissa S. Pielet; however, she later withdrew. Another individual, Keith Bank, assumed Pielet’s role as party plaintiff for a short time, but also withdrew. Appellants, consist ing of Mark Munaretto, William Skrzelowski, John Girsch, Edward Zifkin, and Mark Wheeles, filed a motion to intervene which was granted and thereby became the intervening plaintiffs below.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}], &#39;judges&#39;: []}}}

The circuit court held that the insured’s failure to comply with the “Notice of Circumstance” provision precluded coverage under the Lexington policy and granted summary judgment in favor of Lexington. On appeal, Federal contends the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Lexington because sufficient notice was provided as outlined in the insurance policy. We affirm.\nWe adopt the facts as outlined in the judgment of the circuit court.\nIn October 1998, Jose Barajas was seriously injured by a detonator manufactured by the Ensign-Bickford Company (Ensign) and sold by American East Explosives, Inc. (American East). American East, doing business then as Evenson Explosives, is a subsidiary of ETI Canada, Inc. (ETI). At the time of the accident, American East and Ensign were insured by National Union Fire Insurance Company (National Union). Defendant Lexington was their excess carrier from November 29, 1997, through November 29, 1998, and plaintiff, Federal, provided excess coverage from November 29, 1998, through November 29, 1999.\nOn April 18, 2000, Barajas and his spouse filed suit against American East, Ensign, and others, for his injuries. National Union agreed to defend American East and Ensign, and Federal agreed to provide excess coverage. Lexington refused to participate, contending the Barajas claim was not covered under its policy. Once the Barajas litigation settled, Federal filed the instant lawsuit seeking to recover its portion of the settlement from Lexington.\nThe parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment on Federal’s four-count complaint for declaratory relief, indemnification, breach of contract damages, and contribution. The circuit court granted Lexington summary judgment on the four-count complaint and denied summary judgment to Federal. Federal filed this timely appeal.\nAt issue is the notice of circumstance in Lexington’s policy:\n“Whenever the Insured has information relating to a Circumstance which is likely to involve this Policy and gives notice of such Circumstance, in writing, sent by registered or certified mail during the period of this Policy, to the entity designated in Item 4 of the Declarations, then any claim, as respects such Circumstance, which is made, in writing, against the Insured within seven years from the date of the written notification of such Circumstance, to said entity, shall be deemed to have been first made, in writing, against the Insured on the date upon which the notice of the said Circumstance was first sent to said entity, in writing.\nIt is noted that this Insuring Agreement 4 is an option for the Insured and not an obligation and does not alter the provisions of Condition (D) — REPORTING OF LOSSES.” (Emphasis added.)\nWillis Corroon Corporation of Seattle (Willis) is the entity-designated in Item 4. At the time of the Barajas accident, Willis also was American East’s broker in charge of handling all of American East’s general and auto liability claims and the reporting of all those after being notified.\nIt is undisputed American East did not provide Willis with written notification of the Barajas incident. American East’s administrative and risk manager, Carl Clauss, did telephone Willis’s representative, Stanley Heydrick, on the day of the incident or the day after and notified him of the incident. Heydrick does not remember requesting written notice of the Barajas accident, but believes he forwarded the Barajas information to Mr. Jim Sorte in the claims department, which then put National Union, the primary insurer, on notice.\nThe learned trial court correctly stated the standard. “The construction of an insurance policy and a determination of the rights and obligations thereunder are questions of law for the court which are appropriate subjects for disposition by way of summary judgment.” Crum &amp; Forster Managers Corp. v. Resolution Trust Corp., 156 Ill. 2d 384, 391 (1993). Summary judgment should be granted only where the pleadings, depositions, admissions and affidavits, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, show that no genuine issue of material fact exists and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Film &amp; Tape Works, Inc. v. Junetwenty Films, Inc., 368 Ill. App. 3d 462, 468 (2006). While summary judgment may aid the expeditious disposition of a lawsuit, it is a drastic means of disposing of litigation and therefore should be allowed only when the right of the moving party is clear and free from doubt. Purtill v. Hess, 111 Ill. 2d 229, 240 (1986). When parties file cross-motions for summary judgment, they concede the absence of a genuine issue of material fact and invite the court to decide the questions presented as a matter of law. Steadfast Insurance Co. v. Caremark Rx, Inc., 359 Ill. App. 3d 749, 755 (2005). Our review is de novo. Steadfast Insurance Co., 359 Ill. App. 3d at 755.\nA proper analysis of the sufficiency of notice is whether the notice given objectively complied with the potential claim notice provision of a policy. Continental Casualty Co. v. Coregis Insurance Co., 316 Ill. App. 3d 1052, 1063 (2000).\nOn appeal, Federal contends the notice was sufficient because: (1) there was oral notice by telephone the next day that was intended as notice; and (2) notice by fax to AIG Claim Services, Inc. (AIG/CS), was sufficient written notice as Lexington, National Union and AIG/CS are all part of the American International Group, Inc. (AIG), corporate group.\nWe disagree. Mr. Clauss testified at his deposition in pertinent part:\n“Q. At the time ETI provided notice of or notified Willis of the Barajas accident, did you understand that there was a possibility that Mr. Barajas’s injuries would result in a claim against ETI or one of its subsidiaries?\nA. No.\nQ. And why do you say that?\nA. Because we sold product to a customer that did their own blasting. The product was loaded in the hole by Material Service’s employees. Therefore, the only way that ETI should have been involved in the litigation or in the claim would be if it was deemed that the product was defective and that was one of the results of why the accident occurred.\nQ. Okay. A day after the accident occurred, was it known whether the product was deemed defective?\nA. No.\nQ. So is it fair to say that Willis was notified of the Barajas accident in case the product involved in the Barajas accident was deemed defective?\nA. That was always the prudent thing to do.\ns¡t * *\nQ. When notice was provided to Willis of the Barajas accident, did you intend to put all carriers on notice of the incident?\n***\nA. That would have been Willis’s decision.\nQ. Was it your understanding that Willis would put the carriers on notice of the Barajas incident?\n***\nA. I feel that they did the right thing, which was notify [National Union,] [which] had a million dollars’ worth of coverage since I didn’t expect it to be a claim.”\nFurther, Willis’s claims representative, Jim Sorte, testified in his deposition in pertinent part:\n“Q. [D]id you in your capacity with Willis in 1998/1999, in those years, did you have the authority to unilaterally decide to put an ETI excess insurer on notice of an incident or claim without first discussing it with Mr. Clauss?\n***\nA. No.\nQ. Would it be fair to say that before anyone at Willis with respect to the ETI account could put an excess insurer on notice of an incident, occurrence or claim, Willis first needed the approval and authority of Mr. Clauss to do so?\n***\nA. Yes.\nQ. Did Mr. Clauss on October 13 of 1998 or at any time ever ask you to put Lexington on notice of the Barajas case under the Lexington claims-made excess policy in effect between November of 1997 and November of 1998?\nA. I don’t believe so, no.”\nThis testimony reveals that Mr. Clauss did not instruct Willis to put Lexington on notice of the Barajas claim; rather, he left it to Willis to figure out which carrier to notify. Mr. Clauss further stated he believed Willis did the “right thing” in notifying National Union (and not the excess carrier Lexington) because Mr. Clauss did not expect a claim to be made.\nOn this record, there simply is no evidence that American East notified Willis, either by telephone or in writing, that it should put Lexington on notice of the Barajas accident. Accordingly, the circuit court was correct in finding that American East failed to comply with the notice of circumstance provision of the Lexington policy.\nFederal contends Lexington received notice of the Barajas incident through an “Acord General Liability Notice of Occurrence Claim” (the Acord) Willis sent by fax to AIG, which was received by AIG/CS on October 14, 1998. Federal argues that Lexington and National Union are both AIG member companies and that AIG/CS accepts notices from brokers or policyholders on behalf of Lexington and National Union. Federal contends this court should find, as a matter of law, that notice to AIG, AIG/CS, or National Union constituted notice to Lexington.\nWe disagree. The Acord referenced only National Union, not Lexington. The Acord contained a section allowing identification of an “umbrella/excess policy in force”; however, this section was left blank by Willis. As aptly noted by the circuit court, “Merely because National Union fortuitously belonged to the same organization as Lexington does not impute notice of the Barajas incident to Lexington. Moreover, there is not even any evidence suggesting that the sender of the Acord intended to notify anyone other than National Union, the only insurer identified therein, of the Barajas incident.”\nFederal also argues:\n“The Lexington Policy’s Other Insurance provision conflicts with the Federal Policy’s Other Insurance provisions because both policies purport to make their insurance excess of all other applicable insurance. Since the Other Insurance provisions are mutually repugnant, this Court should disregard them, and require both insurer[s] to contribute on a pro rata basis, which [in] this case would require Lexington to reimburse Federal for one-half of the settlement of the Barajas lawsuit, plus interest.”\nFederal’s argument is unavailing. As discussed above, Federal is not entitled to any reimbursement from Lexington due to .the insured’s failure to comply with the notice of circumstance provision of the Lexington policy.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the circuit court.\nAffirmed.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}]
[{&#39;author&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE CARTER&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE CARTER\ndelivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\nJustice Lytton concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nJustice Wright dissented, with opinion.\nOPINION\nAfter a jury trial, the defendant, Phillip Connolly, was convicted of domestic battery (720 ILCS 5/12 — 3.2(a)(2) (West 2006)) and endangering the life or health of a child (720 ILCS 5/12 — 21.6(a) (West 2006)). The trial court sentenced the defendant to 364 days’ imprisonment. The defendant appealed, contending that his domestic battery conviction must be reversed and his endangering the life or health of a child conviction must be vacated because the trial court improperly admitted a hearsay statement of Melissa Connolly. We affirm.\nFACTS\nThe charges against the defendant arose from an argument between the defendant and his wife, Melissa, outside their home. The couple’s neighbor, Dina Perritano, testified that she was sleeping on her couch after working all night when her son woke her up because the defendant and Melissa were arguing outside. Perritano went outside and observed Melissa seated in the driver’s seat of her vehicle and the defendant standing in the open doorway of the vehicle, holding their son on his hip. Perritano testified that the defendant and Melissa were screaming and yelling at each other, and Melissa threatened to call the police. Perritano returned to her home and telephoned the police. When she turned back toward the argument, the child was sitting in the middle of the two-lane street and the defendant was leaning over Melissa while screaming at her. Perritano estimated that the child was in the middle of the street for a few minutes. Perritano saw a car coming slowly down the street, but it came to a stop and the defendant picked up the child and left. Melissa remained in her vehicle until the police arrived. Perritano estimated that the police arrived a few minutes after the defendant left with the child. When the police officer arrived that day, he spoke separately to Melissa and then spoke to Perritano.\nJon Muehlbauer, a deputy with the Will County sheriffs department, testified he arrived at the scene within five to seven minutes after he was dispatched. He first spoke to Melissa, who appeared upset, agitated, and nervous upon his arrival. The defense objected to allowing Muehlbauer to testify as to what Melissa told him, but the trial court overruled the objection, finding an adequate foundation, and allowed Melissa’s statements to be admitted under the excited utterance exception to hearsay. Muehlbauer went on to testify that Melissa told him that the defendant pulled her out of her vehicle and battered her about the head. Melissa also told Muehlbauer that the defendant put the child down in the middle of the street. The deputy did not recall seeing injuries on Melissa. He then spoke to Perritano and the driver of the car that stopped. Muehlbauer attempted to locate the defendant, but could not find him. Muehlbauer located the child in a residence down the street and returned the child to his mother, Melissa. The State rested, and the defendant’s motion for a directed verdict was denied.\nMelissa testified for the defense. She stated that, at the time of the incident, their child was 19 months old. Melissa testified that she had an argument with the defendant, but that he did not strike her and he never set the child down. She testified that she was calm when she spoke to Muehlbauer about 10 minutes after the argument.\nThe defendant also testified. He denied putting the child in the street. He testified that he had an argument with Melissa, but he could not recall what it was about. He heard Perritano say that she was calling the police, but he did not run away with the child. According to the defendant, he was taking the child for a walk in his stroller.\nThe jury found the defendant guilty of both offenses, and the defendant’s motion for a new trial was denied. At sentencing, the trial judge noted that the defendant and Melissa were “two of the least believable witnesses [he] ever heard” in the two decades he had been licensed to practice law and sentenced the defendant to 364 days’ imprisonment.\nANALYSIS\nThe defendant contends that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting Melissa’s statements to the officer under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule. The defendant also contends that the admission of Melissa’s statements violated the confrontation clause of the United States Constitution (U.S. Const., amend. VI). The defendant argues that if Melissa’s out-of-court statements were improperly admitted by the court as an exception to the hearsay rule, double jeopardy bars his retrial for domestic battery.\nThe State contends the trial court properly admitted Melissa’s responses to the officer’s questions as an excited utterance. Alternatively, the State submits that even if an error occurred, there is no double jeopardy bar to a retrial on these charges.\nWe begin by considering the defendant’s argument that Melissa’s statements constituted inadmissible hearsay. Out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted are inadmissible hearsay and considered to lack reliability unless an exception applies. People v. Tenney, 205 Ill. 2d 411 (2002).\nThe State offered Melissa’s out-of-court statements to the jury for the truth of the matters asserted, so her statements were hearsay unless an exception applied. The trial court found that the excited utterance, or spontaneous declaration, exception applied, and it admitted the statements.\nOur supreme court has explained that the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule is based on human experience. That is, where people are under physical or mental shock, they experience a stress of nervous excitement which produces a statement that expresses the real belief of the speaker as to the facts just observed. People v. Damen, 28 Ill. 2d 464 (1963). It is not unusual for the State to attempt to utilize the excited utterance exception when appropriate. See, e.g., People v. Gwinn, 366 Ill. App. 3d 501 (2006); People v. Robinson, 379 Ill. App. 3d 679 (2008), appeal allowed, 228 Ill. 2d 548 (2008) (table). Given the studied psychological dynamics of domestic violence (see generally Mary A.\nDutton, Understanding Women’s Responses to Domestic Violence: A Redefinition of Battered Woman Syndrome, 21 Hofstra L. Rev. 1191 (1993)), efforts by the State to rely on the hearsay exception might arise from the recognition that domestic violence is a type of crime that is very susceptible to intimidation of the victim to ensure the victim does not testify against the abuser. See People v. Dabbs, 239 Ill. 2d 277 (2010) (discussing the legitimate concern of the General Assembly with the effective prosecution of crimes of domestic violence).\nFor the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule to apply, “there must be an occurrence sufficiently startling to produce a spontaneous and unreflecting statement, there must be an absence of time for the declarant to fabricate the statement, and the statement must relate to the circumstances of the occurrence.” People v. Sutton, 233 Ill. 2d 89, 107 (2009). Courts look at the totality of the circumstances to determine whether a statement is admissible under the excited utterance exception. People v. Williams, 193 Ill. 2d 306 (2000). An event can be sufficiently startling, even in the absence of physical injury, based on the totality of the circumstances. Robinson, 379 Ill. App. 3d 679.\nWhile the amount of time necessary for fabrication may vary greatly, the critical inquiry with regard to time is whether the statement was made while the declarant was still affected by the excitement of the event. Sutton, 233 Ill. 2d 89. The time factor is not viewed in isolation, but in the context of the event. For example, a 15- to 20-minute delay between an incident of home invasion and aggravated domestic battery and the victim’s statement to the police concerning the events does not destroy spontaneity under given circumstances. Gwinn, 366 Ill. App. 3d 501 (victim was crying, trembling, and visibly shaken, as well as injured, when she made the statement to officers).\nThe fact that a statement is made in response to an inquiry does not destroy spontaneity. People v. Lisle, 376 Ill. App. 3d 67 (2007), appeal denied, 226 Ill. 2d 597 (2007). In Damen, 28 Ill. 2d at 470, a forcible rape case, our supreme court noted the fact an officer asked the complainant “what happened” was insufficient to destroy its spontaneity. See also Williams, 193 Ill. 2d 306. In another case, when the statements are made in respect to a police officer’s questions more than 20 minutes after the crime had occurred, the victim’s statement was still considered a spontaneous declaration. Sutton, 233 Ill. 2d 89 (victim’s statement made while excitement of the event predominated). An excited utterance can still be made even after having spoken previously to another after the event. See People v. House, 141 Ill. 2d 323 (1990) (rejecting the argument that a declarant cannot make a spontaneous declaration to a person after having spoken previously to another).\nThe trial court in the instant case determined that Melissa’s statements were admissible as excited utterances, so our review is limited to whether that determination was an abuse of discretion. People v. Cookson, 215 Ill. 2d 194 (2005). Evidentiary rulings are within the sound discretion of the trial court, and we review those rulings with deference to the trial court. People v. Caffey, 205 Ill. 2d 52 (2001). This court will find an abuse of discretion only where the trial court’s ruling is arbitrary, fanciful, unreasonable, or where no reasonable person could take the view adopted by the trial court. Caffey, 205 Ill. 2d 52. Inasmuch as the application of the excited utterance exception always depends on the circumstances of the particular case, it has been suggested that the trial court should be clothed with a reasonable degree of latitude. Peterson v. Cochran &amp; McCluer Co., 308 Ill. App. 348 (1941); see 6 John H. Wigmore, Evidence §1750 (Chadbourn rev. ed. 1976).\nIn this case, the totality of the circumstances supports the trial court’s finding that Melissa’s statements were excited utterances. Domestic violence is an intolerable offense sufficiently startling to render inoperative the normal reflective thought processes of the victim. Her statements were made within a relatively short time span following the occurrence that allowed the emotional upset to continue. There does not appear to have been any time for reflection by Melissa prior to her statements to the police officer. Muehlbauer arrived on the scene within minutes of the argument between Melissa and the defendant. Melissa was still at the scene in a nervous, upset, and agitated condition, directly related to the event. Her child was absent. The defendant was no longer at the scene, and he had taken the child. Muehlbauer left Melissa at the scene to look for the defendant and the child. We find no abuse of discretion in the conclusion that Melissa’s responses to police questioning on the scene were excited utterances and were admissible.\nHaving determined that Melissa’s statements to Muehlbauer were admissible as exceptions to hearsay, we must address the constitutional issue based on the confrontation clause. Melissa did not testify for the State, so she was not subject to cross-examination for purposes of the sixth amendment confrontation clause. See Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, 557 U.S. 305 (2009) (confrontation clause imposes a burden on the prosecution, not the defendant, to produce witnesses against the defendant).\nThe confrontation clause provides that “[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right *** to be confronted with the witnesses against him.” U.S. Const., amends. VI, XIV. A testimonial out-of-court statement by a witness who does not testify at trial is not admissible unless the witness is unavailable to testify and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination. Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004); People v. Stechly, 225 Ill. 2d 246 (2007). The confrontation clause does not apply, however, if the statements are not testimonial. Stechly, 225 Ill. 2d 246.\nThe trial court found that Melissa’s statements were not testimonial and, thus, did not violate the confrontation clause with their admission into evidence. A sixth amendment confrontation clause violation claim is a question of law that we review de novo. People v. Williams, 238 Ill. 2d 125 (2010); People v. Lovejoy, 235 Ill. 2d 97 (2009).\nA statement is testimonial if it is made in a solemn fashion and is intended to establish a particular fact. Stechly, 225 Ill. 2d 246. However, just because a statement was made to a police officer, standing alone, does not mean the statement is prohibited. A statement made to a law enforcement official is not testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that the primary purpose of any questioning was to address an ongoing emergency. Sutton, 233 Ill. 2d 89. The Davis court applied four factors when deciding whether interrogation was to meet an ongoing emergency: whether the purpose was to determine a past fact or ascertain an ongoing event; whether the situation could be described as an emergency; whether the nature of the questions focused on the present or on the past; and finally, the level of formality involved. Davis v. Washington, 547 U.S. 813 (2006). In such circumstances, the objective intent of the questioner, not the questioner’s status, becomes the determinative question. In re Rolandis G., 232 Ill. 2d 13 (2008).\nMuehlbauer testified that when he arrived at the scene, Melissa was still at the scene and she appeared upset, nervous, and agitated. He first talked to Melissa. She told him that the defendant had pulled her out of her vehicle and battered her about the head, and that the defendant had set the child in the middle of the street. The defendant had also taken the child. After questioning the two other witnesses at the scene, assessing the ongoing situation, Muehlbauer proceeded to try to locate the defendant and the child. In fact, he eventually located the child and then returned the child to his mother, Melissa. We conclude that Melissa’s statements to Muehlbauer were nontestimonial because Muehlbauer was addressing an ongoing emergency. As such, the confrontation clause did not bar the admission of Melissa’s statements. Having found Melissa’s statements were an exception to the hearsay rule that did not violate the confrontation clause, we need not address the double jeopardy argument.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court of Will County is affirmed.\nAffirmed.\nThis excited utterance exception has a long history in the common law of evidence. See Thompson v. Trevanion, (1693) 90 Eng. Rep. 179 (K.B.) (in an action for trespass of the wife of the plaintiff, Chief Justice Holt found that what the wife said immediately upon the hurt received, and before there was time to contrive anything, might be given in evidence); see generally 6 John H. Wigmore, Evidence §§1747 through 1750 (Chadbourn rev. ed. 1976).&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}, {&#39;author&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE WRIGHT,&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE WRIGHT,\ndissenting:\nIn this case, the couple’s neighbor, Dina Perritano, testified that she observed defendant and Melissa screaming and yelling at each other outside their residence while Melissa was seated in the driver’s seat of her vehicle. Perritano observed defendant was standing in the open doorway of the vehicle, holding their son on his hip. During this verbal argument, Perritano heard Melissa threaten to call the police. Perritano did not observe any physical contact between the couple but called the police on her own initiative. Perritano estimated that the police arrived a few minutes later after defendant left with his son.\nJon Muehlbauer, a deputy with the Will County sheriff’s department, testified he arrived at the scene within five to seven minutes after he was dispatched to that location. He spoke to Melissa, who told him that defendant pulled her out of her vehicle and battered her about the head. The officer described her to be upset and nervous.\nFor the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule to apply, “there must be an occurrence sufficiently startling to produce a spontaneous and unreflecting statement, there must be an absence of time for the declarant to fabricate the statement, and the statement must relate to the circumstances of the occurrence.” People v. Sutton, 233 Ill. 2d 89, 107 (2009). In this case, I conclude that the events witnessed by the neighbor do not indicate that there was a sufficiently startling event or the required spontaneity to trigger this narrow and inflexible exception to the hearsay rule.\nGenerally, many people who speak to investigating officers are both upset and nervous. The excited utterance requires something more, that is, a sufficiently startling event to trigger a spontaneous declaration. Mere nervousness and anxiety are not enough.\nHere, the neighbor’s testimony established that heated verbal altercations were not unusual for this couple and that the police officer arrived on the scene between 5 and 10 minutes after the couple separated. This time period would allow sufficient time for Melissa’s personal reflection, thereby negating the spontaneity of her responses to the officer’s questions. Based on the circumstances of this case, it is unclear whether Melissa was upset because her child had been removed from the area by his father or upset by the purported altercation.\nIn my view, the foundation for an excited utterance exception should not vary due to the domestic nature of the underlying offense or based on the reality that the State cannot prove its case without the statement. In this case, the State’s evidence neither satisfied the requirement that the occurrence in this case was startling for this declarant and also failed to establish there was not an opportunity for the declarant’s reflection. Thus, I have reached the conclusion that Melissa’s out-of-court statement to Muehlbauer constituted inadmissible hearsay and requires reversal of defendant’s conviction.\nNext, based on my position as set forth above, I reject defendant’s contention that a retrial for domestic battery is barred based upon double jeopardy considerations. Double jeopardy does not prevent a retrial when a conviction is overturned due to an error in the trial. People v. Lopez, 229 Ill. 2d 322, 367 (2008). When deciding if the evidence was sufficient to sustain a conviction, for double jeopardy purposes, this court may consider all of the evidence admitted at trial, even the erroneously admitted evidence. If viewing all the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, a rational trier of fact could have found all of the elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt, there is no double jeopardy bar to retrial. People v. Lopez, 229 Ill. 2d at 367.\nIn this case, Melissa told the police officer that defendant had pulled her out of the car and battered her about the head. Moreover, upon remand, Melissa could change her mind and elect to testify for the State in a fashion that is consistent with her out-of-court statements to the officer. Viewing all of the evidence, including the improperly admitted evidence, I conclude that a reasonable trier of fact could have found defendant guilty of domestic battery.\nAs for defendant’s conviction of endangering the life or health of a child, the State contends that retrial is not warranted because any error was harmless. Although there was sufficient evidence to sustain the conviction, the impact of the erroneous admission of Melissa’s statements to the officer cannot be considered harmless in this case. See People v. Stechly, 225 Ill. 2d 246 (2007).\nConsequently, I would find the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the out-of-court statement as a spontaneous utterance, vacate both convictions, and remand the cause for a new trial on both charges.\nFor the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;dissent&#39;}]
[{&#39;author&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE GOLDENHERSH&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE GOLDENHERSH\ndelivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\nJustices Welch and Stewart concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nOPINION\nVictor Eck filed a petition for the guardianship of a minor, A.G.G., under the Probate Act of 1975 (Probate Act) (755 ILCS 5/11 — 5 (West 2008)) in the circuit court of Jackson County. After a hearing, the circuit court denied the petition. On appeal, Victor raises issues regarding whether the circuit court erred by denying the petition on the grounds of standing, without holding an evidentiary hearing on the issue. We reverse and remand with directions.\nFACTS\nOn April 27, 2010, Victor filed a petition under the Probate Act, seeking the guardianship of A.G.G., a minor, born in 2007. See 755 ILCS 5/11 — 5 (West 2008). Victor stated that he had been caring for A.G.G. for the previous three years. Victor alleged that A.G.G.’s mother, Jennifer Greer, has been unable and unwilling to care for her and had relinquished that responsibility to him. Victor further alleged that A.G.G.’s biological father was unable and unwilling to care for her, as evidenced by the lack of any involvement in A.G.G.’s life since her birth. At the same time, Victor filed a motion to enter an interim order and appoint a guardian ad litem.\nThe following day the court made a docket entry and entered a separate written order. In the docket entry, the court stated that the petition did not contain any detail on the relationship of Victor to A.G.G. and did not set forth all the allegations required by the Probate Act (755 ILCS 5/11 — 3 (West 2008)). The docket entry stated that Victor had 14 days to comply and that attorney Eugenia Hunter was appointed as the guardian ad litem. The written order of that date also stated that Hunter was appointed as the guardian ad litem. On May 11, 2010, Victor filed an amended petition for guardianship, in which he alleged that he was not the biological father of A.G.G. but was the only father figure A.G.G. has ever known.\nOn June 2, 2010, the court entered an interim order stating that the cause had been heard on the pending petition for a guardianship and a motion to enter an interim order. The order appointed Hunter as the guardian ad litem and authorized her to appoint Victor as the guardian if she deemed it to be in A.G.G.’s best interests. The order granted custody to Victor for the pendency of the proceedings.\nOn June 7, 2010, Jennifer filed a motion to dismiss the amended petition for a guardianship. Jennifer asserted that the allegations in the amended petition did not overcome the presumption that she is willing and able to carry out day-to-day child care decisions for A.G.G. Jennifer asserted that, thus, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to proceed on the petition. See 755 ILCS 5/11 — 5(b) (West 2008). Jennifer also filed a motion to vacate the interim order.\nOn June 7, 2010, the court entered several docket entries and a written order. In one of the docket entries, the court stated: “Court hears motion to vacate 6/2/10 Interim Order. Court continues Mot/ Vacate, Motion to Dismiss.” In the written order, the court set “[a]ll pending” matters for June 21, 2010. On June 18, 2010, Victor filed a response to the motion to dismiss.\nOn June 21, 2010, the guardian ad litem submitted a report outlining her interviews of Jennifer, Victor, and A.G.G. The guardian ad litem stated that Jennifer “has difficulty with the truth or an exceptionally faulty memory.” The guardian ad litem also noted that despite being educated, Jennifer had a sporadic work record and did not have the ability to support herself. The guardian ad litem reported that Jennifer had lived in approximately nine locations in the previous five years and was homeless at the time of the report. The guardian ad litem concluded as follows:\n“If this were a custody case in which ‘best interest’ was the legal issue, I would have no hesitancy in recommending that the best interests of [A.G.G.] were with Victor Eck. This is, however, a guardianship case in which the standard is different and more complex. For this reason, I would prefer to withhold a recommendation until the evidence and testimony are presented.”\nOn June 21, 2010, the court called the case for a hearing. The court began by discussing Jennifer’s motion to dismiss for a lack of standing. Upon direct questioning by the court, the guardian ad litem responded that she thought Jennifer was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on the issue of standing. At that point, counsel for Jennifer stated that Victor had to meet the threshold of standing before the best interests of the child could be considered and that the guardian ad litem’s opinion should be limited to the issue of best interests. The court responded, “[The report of the guardian ad litem] has raised some concerns that the Court had and I think that this Court does have the inherent power, whether or not we get past that initial step, to look out for the best interest of the child; and I have some real concerns that have been raised by the guardian ad litem’s report and we’re going to have evidence today and I’m going to make a determination.”\nJennifer’s counsel responded by asking the court whether this meant that the motion to dismiss had been denied. The court responded by asking if Jennifer’s counsel would like to make an argument or statement for the record. The colloquy continued:\n“[Counsel for Jennifer:] Certainly, your Honor. Then I would just like to state for the record that it is my understanding that the motion to dismiss this petition for guardianship has actually been based on a best standards or best interest of the child’s standard and not on the statute under the Probate Act?\nTHE COURT: Are you asking the Court a question, Ms. Coward?\n[Counsel for Jennifer:] I — originally, your Honor, I asked if the motion to dismiss had been denied.\nTHE COURT: Well I’ll deny the motion to dismiss.\n[Counsel for Jennifer:] Okay, and just for clarification, your Honor, it’s being denied based on best interest of the child standard, is that correct?\nTHE COURT: You don’t wish to argue your motion?\n[Counsel for Jennifer:] No. That’s a question, your Honor.\nTHE COURT: No, it’s not being denied under the best interest of the child. This Court has inherent authority to look out for the best interest of the child and that’s why we’re proceeding on the amended petition today.”\nThe court made the following docket entry: “6/21/10 Case called[;] parties, counsel, GA all present. Ct Denies Mot/D, proceeds to hearing on A.Pet.” The court noted that after denying the motion to dismiss, it conducted a hearing over two days, at which both Victor and Jennifer presented testimony from several witnesses. The docket entry concluded, “Court finds that [Victor] has not proved by a preponderance of evidence that [Jennifer] as natural mother is not willing and able to make and carry out day-to-day child care decisions concerning the minor as per 5/11 — 5(b).” On June 28, 2010, the court entered a written order denying the petition on the grounds that Victor had failed to rebut the presumption that Jennifer is willing and able to carry out day-to-day child care decisions.\nVictor appeals.\nANALYSIS\nThe results of the procedure used by the trial court are inherently unreliable. At the beginning of the proceedings of June 21, 2010, the trial court denied Jennifer’s request to conduct an evidentiary hearing on the issue of standing. The court then proceeded to entertain evidence seemingly on the best interests of the minor. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court denied the petition, applying the standard for standing. The failure of the court to entertain a hearing on the standard on which it denied the petition undermines the credibility of its ruling and mandates a reversal.\nSection 11 — 5 of the Probate Act dictates the grounds for the appointment of a guardian. 755 ILCS 5/11 — 5 (West 2008). In order to grant a petition for a guardianship, a trial court must make two evidentiary findings. Paragraph (a) provides that upon the filing of a petition the court may appoint a guardian as “the court finds to be in the best interest of the minor.” 755 ILCS 5/11 — 5(a) (West 2008). Paragraph (b) provides that a court lacks jurisdiction to proceed on a petition if the minor has a parent “whose parental rights have not been terminated, whose whereabouts are known, and who is willing and able to make and carry out day-to-day child care decisions concerning the minor.” 755 ILCS 5/11 — 5(b) (West 2008).\nThe standards of the best interests of the minor, in paragraph (a), and a parent who is “willing and able,” in paragraph (b), are separate questions of fact. Historically, Illinois courts have found guidance in the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act (Marriage Act) when determining the best interests of a minor in guardianship proceedings. 750 ILCS 5/602(a) (West 2008); In re Marriage of Russell, 169 Ill. App. 3d 97, 102, 523 N.E.2d 193, 197 (1988); In re Estate of Suggs, 149 Ill. App. 3d 793, 799, 501 N.E.2d 307, 310 (1986). After the recent amendment to the provision for the revocation of a guardianship, effective January 1, 2011, the Probate Act lists factors for determining best interests, including the interaction with the parent, the ability of the parent to provide a nurturing environment, and the stability of the parties. Pub. Act 96 — 1338 (eff. Jan. 1, 2011) (amending 755 ILCS 5/11 — 14.1 (West 2008)).\nThe question of whether a parent meets the willing-and-able standard set forth in paragraph (b) is a separate test from the best-interests-of-the-minor standard. Paragraph (b) sets forth a threshold for standing under the Probate Act that replaces a previous interpretation derived from the Marriage Act. In re R.L.S., 218 Ill. 2d 428, 436, 844 N.E.2d 22, 28 (2006), abrogating In re Person &amp; Estate of New-some, 173 Ill. App. 3d 376, 379, 527 N.E.2d 524, 525 (1988); In re Marriage of Haslett, 257 Ill. App. 3d 999, 1006, 629 N.E.2d 182, 186 (1994); In re Person &amp; Estate of Barnhart, 232 Ill. App. 3d 317, 320, 597 N.E.2d 1238, 1240 (1992). Paragraph (b) states, “There shall be a rebuttable presumption that a parent of a minor is willing and able to make and carry out day-to-day child care decisions concerning the minor, but the presumption may be rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence.” 755 ILCS 5/11 — 5(b) (West 2008).\nThe seminal case instructing on the appointments of guardians under the Probate Act is In re R.L.S., 218 Ill. 2d 428, 436, 844 N.E.2d 22, 28 (2006). In re R.L.S. held that the standing requirement contained in paragraph (b) protects the superior rights of parents and ensures that guardianship proceedings pass constitutional muster. In re R.L.S., 218 Ill. 2d at 441, 844 N.E.2d at 31. In re R.L.S. explained the procedural protections outlined in section 11 — 5:\n“By allowing a guardianship petition to proceed to a hearing on the merits over the wishes of a parent only when the parent has been established to be unwilling or unable to carry out day-to-day childcare decisions, the Probate Act respects the superior rights of parents while also insuring to protect the health, safety, and welfare of children.” In re R.L.S., 218 Ill. 2d at 441, 844 N.E.2d at 31.\nIn the case at hand, the trial court denied the request for an evidentiary hearing on the standing issue and proceeded to entertain evidence supposedly on the remaining question of best interests. After the evidentiary hearing, the court did not rule on the question of best interests but dismissed the petition on the standard for standing. The proceedings before the trial court were, at best, muddled. The process both diverged from the burden created by a rebuttable presumption and undermined any claim that the issue of standing was actually heard.\nThe court’s procedure displayed a misunderstanding of the nature of the standing requirement as a rebuttable presumption. Once a presumption is overcome, it ceases to operate. In re Estate of Miller, 334 Ill. App. 3d 692, 698, 778 N.E.2d 262, 267 (2002); In re J.A., 316 Ill. App. 3d 553, 562, 736 N.E.2d 678, 686 (2000). The record indicates that by the court’s prehearing comments and ruling on the motion to dismiss, the parties to the action were led to believe that the presumption had dissolved. Although the court might have initially erred against Jennifer by not holding a hearing on standing, the court prejudiced Victor by reviving the presumption after the conclusion of the evidence.\nUltimately, the court ruled on the standing issue without conducting an evidentiary hearing on the issue. The record indicates that the issue of whether Jennifer was a willing and able parent was not actually tried. The court denied the request for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of whether Jennifer was a willing and able parent and then proceeded to what was ostensibly a dispositional hearing on best interests. Thus, the parties were not on notice that the issue of standing was being considered by the court, and any evidence introduced on the issue was merely coincidental. Alternatively, the court’s action could be characterized as misinterpreting the test for best interests. Either way, the issue of standing was never tried.\nThe interpretation of comparable statutory schemes for determining custody supports a reversal. Under other statutory schemes, the fitness of a parent and the best interests of a child are seen as distinct matters, and courts have recognized the potential for prejudice and confusion when the issues are not addressed at separate hearings. In re Adoption of Syck, 138 Ill. 2d 255, 276, 562 N.E.2d 174, 184 (1990); In re C.L.T., 302 Ill. App. 3d 770, 779, 706 N.E.2d 123, 129 (1999) (Adoption Act (750 ILCS 50/1 (West 1996))); In re M.B., 332 Ill. App. 3d 996, 1004, 773 N.E.2d 1204, 1210 (2002) (Juvenile Court Act of 1987 (705 ILCS 405/2 — 3 (West 2000))). This court need not address whether it is possible for the separate issues of standing and best interests in the Probate Act to be considered at a consolidated proceeding. See Freeman v. Settle, 75 Ill. App. 3d 799, 804, 393 N.E.2d 1385, 1388 (1979) (the record indicated that the court and the parties clearly understood their responsibilities at a single hearing under the Adoption Act); see also In re Custody of Gonzalez, 204 Ill. App. 3d 28, 31-32, 561 N.E.2d 1276, 1278 (1990) (a waiver of the standing requirement in a custody case under the Marriage Act). At best, the proceedings in this case are so muddled that they leave the factual underpinnings of the court’s decision unreliable.\nJennifer contends that Victor waived his right to appeal a lack of an evidentiary hearing on the standing issue. Victor did not object to the lack of a hearing on the standing issue. Indeed, Jennifer points out that Victor was perfectly happy with the trial court’s prehearing ruling.\nThis, however, misconstrues why the proceedings were flawed. Victor had no reason to call for an evidentiary hearing on the standing issue, or even present evidence on the issue, because the trial court indicated that he had already been granted standing. Although Jennifer is able to point to comments by the trial court at the conclusion of the hearing referring to paragraph (b), the undeniable import of the trial court’s prehearing comments was that the ostensible purpose of the hearing was the question of best interests, not standing. Thus, the trial court’s conclusory ruling and posthearing comments defy application of the standard of review this court would apply if the issue had actually been tried. See In re Guardianship of K.R.J., 405 Ill. App. 3d 527, 535-36 (2010) (describing the mixed standard of review applied when standing is tried).\nThe nature of the standing requirement as a protection for parents, instead of petitioners, does not diminish the magnitude of the trial court’s error. The application of a standard for which there was no evidentiary hearing and the revival of a presumption that the court indicated had been overcome mandate a remand for an actual evidentiary hearing on the standing issue.\nThe comments of the trial court that Jennifer relies on for her claim of waiver raise other issues. Jennifer notes that the trial court referred to paragraph (b) after the conclusion of the evidence. The court stated that the Probate Act limited its consideration to acts of commission and excluded acts of omission as evidence. The Probate Act makes no such distinction.\nThe trial court also commented that the role of the guardian ad litem was limited to issues concerning the best interests of the minor. In denying the request for an evidentiary hearing on the issue of standing, the trial court suggested that the guardian ad litem would be precluded from commenting on whether Jennifer was a willing-and-able parent. Again, there is no basis for this limitation. The court had plenary jurisdiction over the person of the minor, and the authority to appoint the guardian ad litem was derived from common law. In re Estate of Green, 359 Ill. App. 3d 730, 737, 835 N.E.2d 403, 409 (2005).\nCONCLUSION\nAccordingly, the order of the circuit court of Jackson County is hereby reversed, and the matter is remanded with directions to conduct an evidentiary hearing on standing as described in the Probate Act (755 ILCS 5/11 — 5 (West 2008)).\nReversed; cause remanded with directions.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}]
[{&#39;author&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE EPSTEIN&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE EPSTEIN\ndelivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\nJustices Fitzgerald Smith and Joseph Gordon concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nOPINION\nDefendant Calvert White appeals from a burglary conviction in October 2008 following a jury trial. He maintains he is entitled to a new trial based on the prosecutor’s closing argument; the trial court’s alleged failure to comply with Supreme Court Rule 431(b) (Ill. S. Ct. R. 431(b) (eff. May 1, 2007)); and the trial court’s allegedly improper admission of defendant’s two prior convictions. Defendant further claims the trial court unconstitutionally enhanced his sentence under section 5—5—3(c)(8) of the Unified Code of Corrections (730 ILCS 5/5—5—3(c)(8) (West 2008)), warranting a resentencing. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\nBACKGROUND\nDefendant was arrested for burglary on June 28, 2007, shortly after 1:30 a.m. He took a decoy purse from an unmarked police car. Defendant testified at trial that he took the purse, as well as a carton of cigarettes and a bottle, from the car, believing they belonged to “Slim,” someone he knew. Slim allegedly directed defendant to take the items out of the car and watch them while Slim ran into a liquor store that was about to close. Defendant was arrested when he started to cross the street, allegedly intending to merely sit at the bus stop across the street and wait for Slim.\nThe State called three witnesses. Officer Brian Rodriguez testified that he was part of the burglary investigation on June 28, 2007, that led to defendant’s arrest. The area at which defendant was arrested allegedly had an ongoing problem of thefts from cars. Officer Rodriguez’s role was to watch the decoy purse that had been placed on the passenger seat of the unmarked police car. The car was approximately 45 to 50 feet away from him, with its windows completely open. Defendant allegedly approached the car, looked inside, backed up, and turned his head from side to side. He then approached the car a second time and removed the purse through the passenger window. Officer Rodriguez did not see defendant talking to anyone nor did he notice anyone around him. Defendant then allegedly placed the purse under his arm and walked away from the car, crossing the street. Officer Rodriguez radioed other officers and described defendant, who was then arrested.\nOfficer Billy Todde, another member of the investigation team, testified that he parked the unmarked car at the scene, placed the decoy purse on the front seat, lowered the windows, and walked away. He then entered another unmarked car to await further instructions from Officer Rodriguez. After being notified that defendant had taken the purse, Officer Todde returned to the scene and stopped defendant in the middle of the street, about 30 feet from the car. He found the purse in defendant’s possession and arrested him.\nOfficer Mark Schlink, the State’s rebuttal witness, affirmed Officer Todde’s testimony and added that defendant was carrying only the decoy purse and nothing else. The State also offered, in rebuttal, certified copies of defendant’s two misdemeanor retail theft convictions from May 20, 1999, and May 17, 1999 (People’s Exhibits 2 and 3). The trial court admitted those convictions, but barred the introduction of defendant’s two other misdemeanor theft convictions from 1998 and 1999, finding that the prejudicial impact outweighed the probative value. Defendant’s convictions were admitted solely to impeach his testimony. Nonetheless, the prosecutor argued in closing that: “The defendant is a thief, and you know he’s a thief because of People’s Exhibit No. 2 and People’s Exhibit No. 3.” Defendant did not object. The trial court later instructed the jurors:\n“Any evidence that was received for a limited purpose should not be considered by you for any other purpose. You should disregard testimony and exhibits which the Court has refused or stricken.\nThe evidence which you should consider consists only of the testimony of the witnesses and the exhibits which the Court has received.\n❖ ❖ ❖\nOpening statements are made by the attorneys to acquaint you with the facts they expect to prove. Closing arguments are made by the attorneys to discuss the facts and circumstances in the case and they should be confined to the evidence and to reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.\nNeither opening statements nor closing arguments are evidence, as we talked about earlier, and any statement or argument made by the lawyers which is not based on any of the evidence should be disregarded.\n% ❖ #\nEvidence of defendant’s previous conviction of any offense may be considered by you only as it may effect his believability as a witnesses and must not be considered by you as evidence of his guilt of the offense which is he is charged.”\nThe jury returned a guilty verdict. Defendant then filed a motion for acquittal and a new trial, arguing that the State had not sustained its burden and that his prior convictions were inadmissible. The motion was denied.\nAt sentencing, the trial court inquired whether the parties wished to amend defendant’s presentencing investigation report (PSI). Defendant declined to do so, and the State corrected two convictions, without any objection. The State then argued in aggravation that a mandatory Class X sentence should be imposed because defendant allegedly had “[a] 1991 conviction for possession for a controlled substance with intent to deliver, which was a class 1. And there is a 1999 conviction for delivery of a controlled substance, which was also a class 1.” Although the PSI shows that defendant was convicted for delivery of a controlled substance in 1990, not 1999, defendant’s counsel, who argued in mitigation, did not object to the prosecutor’s statement or attempt to correct it.\nThe trial court imposed a Class X sentence, finding:\n“In taking into account, there [are] a lot of misdemeanor convictions in the defendant’s history, and its true that he does have five prior felony convictions, the last of which was in, was from a 1990 case, later in 1991, so some 17 years before this case occurred. So I’m taking all of those factors into consideration.\nBased upon the defendant’s background, I find he is subject to mandatory class X sentencing, based upon the two convictions highlighted by the State. I’ll sentence the defendant to six years, the minimum sentence under the law, in the Illinois Department of Corrections.”\nDefendant did not object to the sentence nor did he file a postsentencing motion. He nevertheless maintains his sentence was unconstitutionally enhanced, that the trial court erred in admitting his two prior theft convictions, and that it failed to comply with Rule 431(b).\nANALYSIS\nA. Defendant Has Forfeited His Rule 431(b) Claim\n• 1 Amended Supreme Court Rule 431(b) mandates:\n“The court shall ask each potential juror, individually or in a group, whether that juror understands and accepts the following principles: (1) that the defendant is presumed innocent of the charge(s) against him or her; (2) that before a defendant can be convicted the State must prove the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt; (3) that the defendant is not required to offer any evidence on his or her own behalf; and (4) that the defendant’s failure to testify cannot be held against him or her; however, no inquiry of a prospective juror shall be made into the defendant’s failure to testify when the defendant objects.\nThe court’s method of inquiry shall provide each juror an opportunity to respond to specific questions concerning the principles set out in this section.” Ill. S. Ct. R. 431(b) (eff. May 1, 2007).\nAs recently explained by our supreme court:\n“The language of Rule 431(b) is clear and unambiguous. The rule states that the trial court ‘shall ask’ potential jurors whether they understand and accept the enumerated principles. While the prospective jurors may be questioned individually or in a group, the method of inquiry must ‘provide each juror an opportunity to respond to specific questions concerning the Rule 431(b) principles.’ The committee comments emphasize that trial courts may not simply give ‘a broad statement of the applicable law followed by a general question concerning the juror’s willingness to follow the law.’ 177 Ill. 2d R. 431, Committee Comments.\nRule 431(b), therefore, mandates a specific question and response process. The trial court must ask each potential juror whether he or she understands and accepts each of the principles in the rule. The questioning may be performed either individually or in a group, but the rule requires an opportunity for a response from each prospective juror on their understanding and acceptance of those principles.” People v. Thompson, 238 Ill. 2d 598, 607 (2010).\nHere, the trial court instructed the jurors:\n“Under our law, a defendant is presumed to he innocent of the charge placed against him. The presumption of innocence stays with the defendant throughout the whole trial even during your deliberations on the verdict and it’s not overcome unless from looking at all of the evidence in the case you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty.\nThe defendant is not required to prove his innocence and that means the defendant does not have to call any witnesses, the defendant himself does not have to testify, that’s true in this case and in every criminal case across the country. The reason for that is it’s the State’s burden of proving somebody guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by themselves. The defendant does not have to put on any evidence at all.”\nThe court continued:\n“As I just stated a couple of minutes ago, the defendant in this case just like every criminal case across our country is presumed to be innocent of the charge against him, and what that means is that he doesn’t have to put any evidence forward on his own behalf, he must be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by the State. Raise your hand if you don’t understand that. Nobody is raising your hand as I expected — I’m sorry, you are raising your hand. What is your name, ma’am.\nPROSPECTIVE JUROR: Essie Bowman.\nTHE COURT: Okay.\nPROSPECTIVE JUROR: I hear everything you are saying but I don’t pick all that, I have special need, people help me when I—\nTHE COURT: Ms. Bowman, what I’m going to ask the attorneys to do is write down your name so if you happen to be any of the people that we talk to individually, Ms. Bowman, I will talk to you more fully about that, okay.\nPROSPECTIVE JUROR: Okay.\nTHE COURT: There are no other hands raised. Other than Ms. Bowman, is there anybody here even though you understand, anybody here who has some fundamental problem with that cornerstone of our criminal justice system?\n(No response.)\nTHE COURT: Nobody is raising their hand.”\nThe trial court sufficiently complied with Rule 431(b) with respect to the State’s burden of proof, defendant’s evidentiary burden, and the presumption of innocence. Defendant disagrees, arguing that the trial court’s inquiry improperly “blurred the distinction between the individuals principles and did not afford the prospective jurors an adequate opportunity to express doubt or bias about the individual concepts.” This argument fails. We have already held that Rule 431(b)\n“does not identify or dictate a particular methodology for establishing the understanding or acceptance of the venire as to those principles.\nImportantly, the rule speaks of ‘principles’ instead of questions. Likewise, the rule does not set out these principles in the form of questions to be posed in haec verba. Nor does the rule provide for any ‘magic words’ or ‘catechism’ in order to satisfy its mandate.” People v. Vargas, 396 Ill. App. 3d 465, 472 (2009).\nPeople v. Digby, 405 Ill. App. 3d 544, 548 (2010) (“Rule 431(b) does not dictate a particular methodology for establishing the venire’s understanding or acceptance of those principles.”). The trial court sufficiently inquired whether the potential jurors understood and accepted the State’s burden of proof, defendant’s evidentiary burden, and the presumption of innocence.\nAs for the fourth principle in Rule 431(b), the trial court instructed the jurors:\n“[Defendant doesn’t have to present any evidence, that means he doesn’t have to testify on his own behalf. If the defendant decides not to testify on his own behalf, that’s one of his rights, guaranteed to him as a citizen of this country and you must not and cannot hold it against him. Is there anybody here who couldn’t follow the law in that regard?\n(No response.)\nTHE COURT: Nobody is raising their hand.”\nWhile this was sufficient to determine whether the jurors accepted defendant’s right not to testify, it did not ask whether the potential jurors understood that right. This inquiry does not satisfy Rule 431(b). Defendant did not, however, raise this issue in the trial court. Although that would generally waive the alleged error on appeal (People v. Enoch, 122 Ill. 2d 176, 186 (1988) (“failure to raise an issue in a written motion for a new trial results in a waiver of that issue on appeal”)), defendant claims Rule 431(b) objections may not be waived or, alternatively, application of the waiver rule should be relaxed for Rule 431(b) claims. Our supreme court recently rejected both arguments, however, stating:\n“To preserve a claim for review, a defendant must both object at trial and include the alleged error in a written posttrial motion. [Citation.] Here, defendant did not object to the trial court’s failure to comply with Rule 431(b) or include that issue in his posttrial motion. Accordingly, we agree that defendant has forfeited appellate review of his claim.\nIn support of his argument on relaxing the forfeiture rule, defendant raises what this court has termed the ‘Sprinkle doctrine.’ We recently explained that under the Sprinkle doctrine, the forfeiture rule may be relaxed when a trial judge oversteps his or her authority in the presence of the jury or when counsel has been effectively prevented from objecting because it would have ‘ “fallen on deaf ears.” ’ People v. Hanson, 238 Ill. 2d 74, 118 (2010), quoting McLaurin, 235 Ill. 2d at 488. The failure to preserve an error will be excused under the Sprinkle doctrine only in extraordinary circumstances, however, such as when a judge makes inappropriate remarks to a jury or relies on social commentary instead of evidence in imposing a death sentence. [Citations.] We have stressed the importance of applying the forfeiture rule uniformly except in compelling situations because failure to raise a claim properly denies the trial court an opportunity to correct an error or grant a new trial, thus wasting time and judicial resources. [Citation.]\nIn this case, there is no indication that the trial court would have ignored an objection to the Rule 431(b) questioning. We presume that the trial court would have complied with the mandatory language of Supreme Court Rule 431(b) had the error been pointed out at trial. Moreover, defendant does not argue that the trial court overstepped its authority in the jury’s presence. A simple objection would have allowed the trial court to correct the error during voir dire. Accordingly, we conclude there is no compelling reason to relax the forfeiture rule in this case.” Thompson, 238 Ill. 2d at 611-12.\nThe same result is warranted here. Defendant has not demonstrated that his objection would have been disregarded by the court nor has he established any other compelling reason for relaxing the forfeiture rule.\nWhere, as in this case, “the defendant fails to make a timely objection and therefore forfeits review, the reviewing court will [nonetheless] examine the record only for plain error.” People v. McLaurin, 235 Ill. 2d 478, 495 (2009). “Plain error is a narrow and limited exception to the general waiver rule.” People v. Pastorino, 91 Ill. 2d 178, 188 (1982). It applies only\n“when (1) a clear or obvious error occurred and the evidence is so closely balanced that the error alone threatened to tip the scales of justice against the defendant, regardless of the seriousness of the error, or (2) a clear or obvious error occurred and that error is so serious that it affected the fairness of the defendant’s trial and challenged the integrity of the judicial process, regardless of the closeness of the evidence.” People v. Piatkowski, 225 Ill. 2d 551, 565 (2007).\n“In a plain-error review, the burden of persuasion remains on the defendant.” McLaurin, 235 Ill. 2d at 495.\nDefendant claims both prongs of plain-error review. The first prong applies “where the evidence in a case is so closely balanced that the jury’s guilty verdict may have resulted from the error and not the evidence.” People v. Herron, 215 Ill. 2d 167, 178 (2005). The court must “consider whether the outcome of defendant’s trial may have been affected by the trial court’s failure to ask potential jurors if they *** understood that defendant had the right not to testify ***. The defendant must establish that the error alone could have led to his conviction.” (Emphasis added.) People v. Willis, 402 Ill. App. 3d 47, 54 (2010). That has not been done here. Even if the evidence was closely balanced, the trial court’s failure to inquire whether the potential jurors understood defendant’s right not to testify was of no consequence since defendant testified at trial and the trial court instructed the potential jurors of defendant’s right not to testify. No plain error occurred under the first prong of review.\nWith respect to the second prong, defendant claims the trial court’s error deprived him of a fair trial by an impartial jury. Defendant has not provided any evidence, however, demonstrating that the jury was biased. As recently clarified by our supreme court, mere violation of Rule 431(b) does not render a jury biased nor warrant automatic reversal under the second prong of plain-error review:\n“A finding that defendant was tried by a biased jury would certainly satisfy the second prong of plain-error review because it would affect his right to a fair trial and challenge the integrity of the judicial process. Critically, however, defendant has not presented any evidence that the jury was biased in this case. Defendant has the burden of persuasion on this issue. We cannot presume the jury was biased simply because the trial court erred in conducting the Rule 431(b) questioning.\nOur amendment to Rule 431(b) does not indicate that compliance with the rule is now indispensable to a fair trial. As we have explained, the failure to conduct Rule 431(b) questioning does not necessarily result in a biased jury, regardless of whether that questioning is mandatory or permissive under our rule. Although the amendment to the rule serves to promote the selection of an impartial jury by making questioning mandatory, Rule 431(b) questioning is only one method of helping to ensure the selection of an impartial jury. [Citation.] It is not the only means of achieving that objective. A violation of Rule 431(b) does not implicate a fundamental right or constitutional protection, but only involves a violation of this court’s rules. [Citation.] Despite our amendment to the rule, we cannot conclude that Rule 431(b) questioning is indispensable to the selection of an impartial jury.” Thompson, 238 Ill. 2d at 614-15.\nSince there is no evidence here that defendant’s jury was biased, the second prong of plain-error review is inapplicable. Defendant has forfeited his Rule 431(b) claim.\nB. Defendant’s Two Prior Theft Convictions Were Properly Admitted\n•2 “A trial court’s ruling on the admissibility of other-crimes evidence will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion. [Citations.] An abuse of discretion occurs where the trial court’s ruling is arbitrary, fanciful or where no reasonable person would take the view adopted by the trial court.” People v. Childress, 338 Ill. App. 3d 540, 545 (2003). Defendant maintains here that the trial court erroneously admitted his two prior misdemeanor theft convictions.\n“Evidence of prior convictions is admissible for impeachment purposes if (1) the witness’s crime was punishable by death or by imprisonment for more than one year, or the crime involved dishonesty or false statement regardless of the punishment; (2) the witness’s conviction or release from confinement, whichever date is later, occurred less than 10 years before the date of trial; and (3) the danger of unfair prejudice does not substantially outweigh the probative value of the conviction.” People v. Whirl, 351 Ill. App. 3d 464, 466-67 (2004).\nDefendant claims his two convictions were of minimal probative value and were highly prejudicial, that the trial court failed to sufficiently weigh the age of the convictions, and that the trial court overlooked defendant’s productive lifestyle since 1999.\n“Trial judges are given factors to use when conducting the balancing test — an exercise in discretion. These include the nature of the prior conviction, its recency and similarity to the present charge, other circumstances surrounding the prior conviction, and the length of the witness’s criminal record. [Citation.] Convictions of the same crime for which the defendant is on trial should be admitted ‘sparingly.’ [Citation.] However, the supreme court found no error where the trial judge in a burglary case allowed the defendant to be impeached with two prior burglary convictions.” Stokes v. City of Chicago, 333 Ill. App. 3d 272, 279-80 (2002).\n“The trial court has discretion in the balancing test and in determining whether a prior conviction is admissible. [Citation.] However, the trial court should not apply the balancing test mechanically [citation], and the record must include some indication that the trial court was aware of its discretion to exclude a prior conviction [citation].” Whirl,\n351 Ill. App. 3d at 467. The trial court need not articulate all the factors considered in its application of the balancing test. People v. Atkinson, 186 Ill. 2d 450, 462-63 (1999). The record here clearly reveals that the trial court was aware of its discretion and exercised it:\n“I understand the arguments of both of the parties and I think that there is always a careful balancing test to be performed when admitting proof of other crimes. In this case, certainly the defendant is charged with burglary and the element is did he intend to commit a theft, so certainly it is somewhat prejudicial that the defendant’s five prior felony convictions that fall within the scope of Montgomery are all thefts.\nOn the other hand, that has to be balanced against the defendant’s testimony and his credibility. I think in this case, weighing the probative value versus the prejudicial effect, I find that it is relevant for the jurors to take into account the convictions listed under A and B, those two retail thefts. I think that suffices, for purposes of allowing the jurors an opportunity to evaluate the defendant’s credibility in light of his background.\nWith respect to misdemeanors that you list in C, D and E which are again all thefts from ’98 and ’99, I’m not going to allow those to come into evidence. I think that would be too prejudicial to let in five of them. I think they are going to be able to weigh his credibility sufficiently with two of the eligible five misdemeanor convictions. So that will be my ruling on that.”\nRather than “verbal homage” to the balancing test, the trial court’s ruling demonstrates reasoned application. While defendant’s convictions were not recent, it cannot be said on the record sub judice that the trial court applied the balancing test improperly. That others may have reached a different result does not render the trial court’s decision erroneous. People v. Chapman, 262 Ill. App. 3d 439, 461 (1992) (“A reviewing court may not simply substitute its judgment for that of the trial court on a matter within the trial court’s discretion.”). The trial court did not abuse its discretion.\nC. The Prosecutor’s Closing Arguments, Though Improper, Were Not Substantially Prejudicial\n•3 “It is well established that prosecutors are afforded wide latitude in closing argument, and improper remarks will not merit reversal unless they result in substantial prejudice to the defendant. [Citation.] In reviewing allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, the closing arguments of both the State and the defendant must be examined in their entirety, and the complained-of remarks must be placed in their proper context.” People v. Kitchen, 159 Ill. 2d 1, 38-39 (1994).\nHere, the prosecutor argued in closing:\n“Your verdict should be based on evidence and the evidence in this case comes from the witnesses’ testimony and the evidence in this case comes from the exhibits that have been entered. The defendant is a thief, and you know he’s a thief because of People’s Exhibit No. 2 and People’s Exhibit No. 3 [defendant’s prior convictions]. The defendant paints a nice picture of himself not doing anything wrong but that doesn’t mean that he wasn’t doing anything wrong.”\nThis argument was clearly improper and contrary to the law governing admission of prior convictions. People v. Williams, 161 Ill. 2d 1, 39-40 (1994) (“It is a fundamental tenet of our criminal justice system *** that the introduction of evidence of other crimes to show or suggest a propensity to commit crime is an improper purpose and is prohibited.”). While we do not in any way condone the prosecutor’s argument, defendant waived the issue by failing to object during closing or through a posttrial motion. “Generally, failure to object to any impropriety in counsel’s closing argument results in waiver unless comments are so inflammatory and prejudicial that [defendant] is denied a fair trial.” Limanowski v. Ashland Oil Co., 275 Ill. App. 3d 115, 118 (1995).\n“In reviewing comments made at closing arguments, this court asks whether or not the comments engender substantial prejudice against a defendant such that it is impossible to say whether or not a verdict of guilt resulted from them. [Citation.] Misconduct in closing argument is substantial and warrants reversal and a new trial if the improper remarks constituted a material factor in a defendant’s conviction. [Citation.] If the jury could have reached a contrary verdict had the improper remarks not been made, or the reviewing court cannot say that the prosecutor’s improper remarks did not contribute to the defendant’s conviction, a new trial should be granted.” People v. Wheeler, 226 Ill. 2d 92, 123 (2007).\nWe are not persuaded on the record sub judice that counsel’s comment was so improper or so prejudicial as to warrant a new trial, particularly in light of the trial court’s subsequent admonishment to the jury that:\n“Any evidence that was received for a limited purpose should not be considered by you for any other purpose. You should disregard testimony and exhibits which the Court has refused or stricken.\nThe evidence which you should consider consists only of the testimony of the witnesses and the exhibits which the Court has received.\nS¡t ifc s¡t\nOpening statements are made by the attorneys to acquaint you with the facts they expect to prove. Closing arguments are made by the attorneys to discuss the facts and circumstances in the case and they should be confined to the evidence and to reasonable inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.\nNeither opening statements nor closing arguments are evidence, as we talked about earlier, and any statement or argument made by the lawyers which is not based on any of the evidence should be disregarded.\n$ ^ ^\nEvidence of defendant’s previous conviction of any offense may be considered by you only as it may effect his believability as a witnesses and must not be considered by you as evidence of his guilt of the offense which is he is charged.”\nWe are not persuaded that defendant was denied a fair trial.\nDefendant maintains reversal is nonetheless warranted because the underlying evidence here was closely balanced. Again, plain-error review may be invoked where “a clear or obvious error occurred and the evidence is so closely balanced that the error alone threatened to tip the scales of justice against the defendant, regardless of the seriousness of the error.” Piatkowski, 225 Ill. 2d at 565. The evidence here was not, however, closely balanced. While defendant and the police officers called by the State provided competing versions of the events, the State also introduced two of defendant’s prior convictions to impeach defendant’s testimony credibility. We are not convinced the prosecutor’s isolated misstatement during closing may have led to the jury’s verdict. Plain-error review is inapplicable.\nD. Defendant’s Sentence Is Affirmed\n•4 Defendant argues that the trial court unconstitutionally imposed a Class X sentence under section 5—5—3(c)(8) of the Unified Code of Corrections (730 ILCS 5/5—5—3(c)(8) (West 2008)) because the State did not prove the statutory elements therein beyond a reasonable doubt and the trial court impermissibly relied on defendant’s presentencing investigation report (PSI) to determine the timing of defendant’s prior crimes and convictions. “To be sentenced under the Class X provision, a defendant must have previously been twice convicted of a Class 2 or greater class felony, and the commission and conviction dates of the prior felonies must have occurred in the chronological order mandated by the statute.” People v. Williams, 149 Ill. 2d 467, 473 (1992). Section 5—5—3(c)(8) mandates, in relevant part:\n“When a defendant, over the age of 21 years, is convicted of a Class 1 or a Class 2 felony, after having twice been convicted in any state or federal court of an offense that contains the same elements as an offense now classified in Illinois as a Class 2 or greater Class felony and such charges are separately brought and tried and arise out of different series of acts, such defendant shall be sentenced as a Class X offender. This paragraph shall not apply unless (1) the first felony was committed after the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1977; and (2) the second felony was committed after conviction of the first; and (3) the third felony was committed after conviction of the second.” 730 ILCS 5/5—5—3(c)(8) (West 2008).\nDefendant claims his sentence was unconstitutionally enhanced because the State failed to establish the timing of his prior offenses beyond a reasonable doubt and that it is “constitutionally insufficient for a sentencing judge to rely on lesser evidence — such as a PSI drafted by the Adult Probation Department — when determining the existence of sentence-enhancing facts.” The State responds, inter alia, that defendant has forfeited this issue because he did not object or file a postsentencing motion.\nDefendant “may challenge the constitutionality of a statute at any time.” People v. Wagener, 196 Ill. 2d 269, 279 (2001). We have already held, however, subsequent to Shepard v. United States, 544 U.S. 13, 16-26 (2005), that section 5—5—3(c)(8) is not unconstitutional and that the factors thereunder need not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. People v. Yancy, 368 Ill. App. 3d 381, 393 (2005); accord People v. Matthews, 362 Ill. App. 3d 953 (2005), appeal denied, 219 Ill. 2d 583 (2006); People v. Rivera, 362 Ill. App. 3d 815 (2005), appeal denied, 218 Ill. 2d 553 (2006). Moreover, a trial court may rely on a PSI to impose a Class X sentence. Rivera, 362 Ill. App. 3d at 821 (“a presentence report, like the one in the instant case, is generally a reliable source for the purpose of inquiring into a defendant’s criminal history”); Yancy, 368 Ill. App. 3d at 393 (holding that “in finding that an enhanced sentence was warranted, the sentencing court was entitled to rely on evidence *** in defendant’s PSI”). Here, defendant’s PSI shows two felony drug convictions: February 9, 1990, and February 14, 1991. Defendant’s Illinois State Police criminal history record, included as part of the PSI, shows that the second offense occurred on August 2, 1990. Defendant’s Class X sentence is affirmed.\nCONCLUSION\nWe affirm defendant’s conviction and sentence. Although the trial court did not fully comply with Rule 431(b), defendant forfeited that issue by failing to timely object, and plain-error review is inapplicable. The trial court did not err in admitting defendant’s two prior theft convictions, and the prosecutor’s closing arguments, though improper, were not so prejudicial as to warrant a new trial.\nAffirmed.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}]
[{&#39;author&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE McLAREN&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE McLAREN\ndelivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\nJustices Zenoff and Burke concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nOPINION\nPetitioner, the City of Sandwich (the City), petitions for review of the certification of representation and the decision and order of respondent Illinois Labor Relations Board, State Panel (Board), certifying respondent Illinois Fraternal Order of Police Labor Council (FOP) as the exclusive representative for collective bargaining purposes of all full-time sworn police officers of the rank of sergeant and below employed by the City. We reverse the decision and order and vacate the certification of representation.\nIn October 2008, the FOP filed a petition with the Board, seeking to include City police officers with the rank of sergeant in its bargaining unit of police officers below the rank of sergeant. The City filed a response and a motion to dismiss, arguing that sergeants are supervisors pursuant to section 3(r) of the Illinois Public Labor Relations Act (Act) (5 ILCS 315/3(r) (West 2008)) and that the City did not agree, pursuant to sections 3(s)(1) and (s)(2) of the Act (5 ILCS 315/3(s)(1), (s)(2) (West 2008)), to certify for collective bargaining purposes a unit consisting of both supervisors and nonsupervisors. An administrative law judge denied the City’s motion to dismiss and ultimately ordered a hearing. On March 31, 2009, after a hearing, the administrative law judge issued a recommended decision and order, concluding that sergeants are not supervisors within the meaning of the Act and ordering a secret ballot election to be conducted among the City’s sergeants. The City filed an exception to the recommended decision and order with the Board, which subsequently found that the City’s sergeants are “public employees within the meaning of the Act” and ordered a representation election.\nWe first must address this court’s jurisdiction over this matter. The parties agree that the petition for review in case No. 2—09— 0800, which was filed after the Board’s decision was entered but before the representation election was held, was untimely. See Chief Judge of the Sixteenth Judicial Circuit v. Illinois State Labor Relations Board, 275 Ill. App. 3d 853, 856 (1995) (“An order by the Board certifying a labor organization as the exclusive bargaining representative of employees in the bargaining unit is a final order that is reviewable directly by this court.”); City of Wood Dale v. Illinois State Labor Relations Board, 166 Ill. App. 3d 881, 887 (1988) (the unit-recognition process is “not complete until certification after an election”). Therefore we lack jurisdiction in appeal No. 2 — 09—0800, and we dismiss that appeal. However, the City timely filed its petition for review in case No. 2 — 09—0985 after the Board-ordered election, and we have jurisdiction over that appeal.\nThe City contends that the Board erred in finding that the City’s sergeants are not supervisors pursuant to the Act. On administrative review of an agency decision, our review extends to all questions of fact and law presented in the record. City of Freeport v. Illinois State Labor Relations Board, 135 Ill. 2d 499, 516 (1990). A reviewing court may not rubber-stamp an administrative decision that it deems inconsistent with the statutory mandate or that frustrates the policy underlying the statute. City of Freeport, 135 Ill. 2d at 516.\nThis court may apply three standards of review when reviewing an agency’s decision. On questions of fact, we deem the agency’s findings and conclusions to be prima facie true and correct, and we will overturn such findings only if they are against the manifest weight of the evidence. Cinkus v. Village of Stickney Municipal Officers Electoral Board, 228 Ill. 2d 200, 210 (2008). A determination is against the manifest weight of the evidence if the opposite conclusion is clearly evident. Cinkus, 228 Ill. 2d at 210. Questions of law we review de novo, granting no deference to the agency. See Cinkus, 228 Ill. 2d at 210-11. Mixed questions of law and fact (where historical facts are established or undisputed, and the issue is whether those facts satisfy the statutory standard) are examined with a standard of review of clearly erroneous. Cinkus, 228 Ill. 2d at 211. An agency’s decision is “clearly erroneous” when the reviewing court is left with a firm and definite conviction that the agency has committed a mistake. Cinkus, 228 Ill. 2d at 211.\nSection 3(r) of the Act provides in relevant part:\n“ ‘Supervisor’ is an employee whose principal work is substantially different from that of his or her subordinates and who has authority, in the interest of the employer, to hire, transfer, suspend, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, direct, reward, or discipline employees, to adjust their grievances, or to effectively recommend any of those actions, if the exercise of that authority is not of a merely routine or clerical nature, but requires the consistent use of independent judgment. Except with respect to police employment, the term ‘supervisor’ includes only those individuals who devote a preponderance of their employment time to exercising that authority, State supervisors notwithstanding. In addition, in determining supervisory status in police employment, rank shall not be determinative. The Board shall consider, as evidence of bargaining unit inclusion or exclusion, the common law enforcement policies and relationships between police officer ranks and certification under applicable civil service law, ordinances, personnel codes, or Division 2.1 of Article 10 of the Illinois Municipal Code, but these factors shall not be the sole or predominant factors considered by the Board in determining police supervisory status.” 5 ILCS 315/ 3(r) (West 2008).\nA police officer meets the definition of supervisor contained in section 3(r) if he: (1) performs principal work substantially different from that of his subordinates; (2) has the authority in the interest of his employer to perform at least 1 of the 11 enumerated supervisory functions or to effectively recommend such action; and (3) consistently uses independent judgment in performing or recommending the enumerated actions. City of Freeport, 135 Ill. 2d at 505-06; Village of Hazel Crest v. Ulinois Labor Relations Board, 385 Ill. App. 3d 109, 114 (2008). The existence of even one indicium of supervisory authority accompanied by independent judgment is sufficient to support a finding of supervisory status. Village of Hazel Crest, 385 Ill. App. 3d at 114.\nHere, the parties stipulated, and the Board found, that the sergeants perform principal work substantially different from that of peace officers with the rank of patrol officers. However, the Board found that the sergeants “do not possess the authority to perform any of the statutory indicia with the requisite independent judgment.” Thus, the Board found the sergeants to be public employees within the meaning of the Act, and it ordered a representation election.\nGENERAL BACKGROUND\nAt the hearing before the administrative law judge, Chief Richard Olson testified about the policies, procedures, and operations of the Sandwich police department. The department has 17 full-time police officers: the chief, 3 sergeants, and 13 patrol officers. The department also employs civilians as dispatchers, crossing guards, and records clerks. There is no other supervisory rank besides chief and sergeant. All officers other than chief are considered to be in the patrol division. The patrol division has three shifts: 6 a.m. to 4 p.m., 3 p.m. to 1 a.m., and 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. Olson was normally scheduled to work approximately 45 hours a week, during the 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. shift, 5 days a week. However, “realistically” he worked closer to 55 hours per week. When he was not at the department office, a sergeant was the highest-ranking officer.\nThe sergeant was in charge of his shift. If no sergeant was present, for example because of vacation or sick leave, the senior patrol officer would run the shift. However, another sergeant would be on call in the event that something serious occurred. The chief was not on the on-call list. One sergeant was always in charge of each shift, whether at the department or on call.\nThe City also introduced into evidence several ordinances and policies. Section 42 — 36 of the Sandwich Municipal Code, which created the position of sergeant of police, states in part:\n“(b) Duties\n(1) A sergeant shall be responsible for the activities of the patrol officer on his assigned shift. The sergeant shall supervise the activities of his shift, seeing that the patrol officer:\na. Knows his zones of responsibility and patrols his zones.\nb. Responds to calls for service promptly.\nc. Completes all investigations promptly.\nd. Collects and preserves evidence properly.\ne. Makes proper arrests, searches and seizures.\nf. Processes prisoners properly.\ng. Signs and completes all reports properly.\nh. Knows and understands the law.\ni. Knows and understands the rules, regulations and orders of the police department.\nj. Knows and understands the proper enforcement of the laws.\n(2) In addition to his supervisory duties, a sergeant shall:\n* s}c *\nc. Investigate complaints against a patrol officer on his shift and make a written report to the chief.” Sandwich Municipal Code ch. 42, §§42 — 36(b)(1), (b)(2)(c).\nDepartment policy No. 102.2, “Police Sergeant Job Description,” states:\n“The work in this class involves the function of a shift supervisor. In this capacity, the primary responsibility is to provide direct day-to-day supervision of uniformed officers and telecommunica tors assigned to a particular shift. The patrol Sergeant is also required to maintain the general patrol officer duties to augment the tasks of their assigned shift.”\nPolicy No. 103.4 defines “Supervisor” as “any rank above patrolman.”\nSergeant Joseph Spartz testified that Chief Olson was “in charge” 33% of the time. As one sergeant was currently on disability, sergeants were in charge 36% of the time and patrol officers were in charge 32% of the time. Spartz stated that he had issued verbal reprimands to patrol officers but that he did not document them if the behavior was corrected immediately. When he investigated a citizen complaint against a patrol officer or recommended some type of disciplinary action, he forwarded his report or recommendation to the chief, who made the decision. Olson did not always carry out Spartz’s suggestions or requests.\nBoth Olson and Spartz also discussed several instances involving recommended disciplinary actions against patrol officers. Ultimately, Olson decided on the action to be taken. Sometimes the discipline was harsher than that recommended by the sergeant; sometimes, it was more lenient. Other times, Olson followed the recommendation.\nANALYSIS\nWe first note that nowhere in its written decision and order did the Board even mention, let alone address, the City ordinance and department policies regarding the supervisory role of the sergeants. Pursuant to section 3(r) of the Act, the Board “shall consider, as evidence of bargaining unit inclusion or exclusion, the common law enforcement policies and relationships between police officer ranks and certification under applicable *** ordinances, [and] personnel codes.” (Emphasis added.) 5 ILCS 315/3(r) (West 2008). While these factors “shall not be the sole or predominant factors considered by the Board in determining police supervisory status” (5 ILCS 315/3(r) (West 2008)), they nevertheless shall be considered. Here, there is no evidence that the Board considered the ordinance and policy code that clearly demonstrate the City’s plan to utilize sergeants as supervisors.\nIn addition to the ordinance and policies, the very nature and reality of the department’s staffing (again, not addressed in the Board’s decision and order) indicate the supervisory nature of the position of sergeant. The hierarchy of the department is limited; there is only one intermediate level between chief and patrol officer — that of sergeant. As Chief Olson testified, he was normally scheduled to work the 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. shift, 5 days a week, for a total of approximately 45 hours a week, although he “realistically” worked closer to 55 per week. When he was not at the department office — approximately 113 to 123 hours per week, or approximately 67% to 73% of the time — a sergeant was the highest-ranking officer, and the only officer with rank above patrol officer. It is unrealistic to conclude that patrol officers are unsupervised two-thirds to almost three-quarters of the time. The chief relies on the sergeants to ensure that the patrol officers are properly performing their jobs; they represent the interests of the chief vis-a-vis the patrol officers. See City of Freeport, 135 Ill. 2d at 519.\nThe Act excludes supervisors from bargaining units that contain their subordinates, in order to avoid the conflict of interest that arises when supervisors, who must apply the employer’s policies to the subordinates, are subject to control by the same union representing the subordinates. City of Freeport, 135 Ill. 2d at 517. It is clear from section 42—36(b)(1) of the Sandwich Municipal Code that a sergeant is responsible for all of the activities of the patrol officers on his shift. In addition, according to section 42— 36(b)(2)(c), sergeants are required to “[investigate complaints against a patrol officer on his shift and make a written report to the chief.” Sandwich Municipal Code ch. 42, §42—36(b)(2)(c). The Board determined that sergeants “do not have the authority to suspend or terminate subordinates, but recommend suspension or termination” and that “sergeants’ disciplinary recommendations are not always followed.” While true, these determinations truly miss the point of the policy underlying the statute. See City of Freeport, 135 Ill. 2d at 516.\nThe evidence in this case included various instances where the chief imposed disciplinary measures that were different (sometimes harsher, sometimes more lenient) from those recommended by the reporting sergeant. There was also at least one instance in which Olson imposed the discipline that had been recommended by the sergeant. However, the very fact that the sergeants are required to investigate complaints against patrol officers and submit reports to the chief shows the type of conflict of interest between sergeants and patrol officers that section 3(s)(1) of the Act seeks to prevent. Even if the sergeant does not ultimately impose the disciplinary action on a patrol officer, it is the sergeant who is required to bring the issue to the attention of the chief, who does impose the discipline. The sergeants must investigate complaints, must report any violations of policy or inappropriate actions, and may recommend that disciplinary action be taken. The power to issue documented verbal reprimands or to recommend more severe disciplinary action has been found to be authority to discipline. See City of Freeport, 135 Ill. 2d at 518-19; Village of Hazel Crest, 385 Ill. App. 3d at 117. There is no less of a conflict of interest where the sergeants are required to investigate, report, and recommend discipline as opposed to ultimately imposing the discipline.\nA sergeant’s independent judgment as to recommended discipline, as well as whether to even report an incident, might well be affected by bonds formed by common union brotherhood. See City of Freeport, 135 Ill. 2d at 519.\nThe Board’s decision is clearly erroneous and misses the forest for the trees. By mechanically applying section 3(r) of the Act, the Board failed to consider the policy underlying the Act and its application to the City’s police force as the force was designed and actually functions. We conclude that the City’s police sergeants do supervise the City’s patrol officers such that including the sergeants in the same bargaining unit as the patrol officers violated section 3(s)(1) of the Act. Therefore, we reverse the Board’s decision and order, and we vacate the certification of representation issued on August 17, 2009.\nBecause we have concluded that the supervisory authority of the sergeants is supported by the indicium of discipline, we need not address the other supervisory functions. See Village of Hazel Crest, 385 Ill. App. 3d at 114.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, case No. 2—09—0800 is dismissed; in case No. 2—09—0985, the agency’s decision and order are reversed and the certification of representation is vacated.\nNo. 2—09—0800, Appeal dismissed.\nNo. 2—09—0985, Reversed and certification of representation vacated.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}]
[{&#39;author&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE KARNEZIS&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE KARNEZIS\ndelivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\nPresiding Justice Cunningham and Justice Connors concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nOPINION\nPlaintiffs Cesar Gamboa, Ruben Nava and Mauro Lopez filed a complaint alleging common law fraud, unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy, intentional infliction of emotional distress and violation of the Illinois Consumer Fraud and Deceptive Business Practices Act (815 ILCS 505/1 et seq. (West 2008)) (Consumer Fraud Act) against defendants Jose Alvarado and Marco’s Digital Video &amp; Photography, Inc. (Marco’s Digital Photography). Plaintiffs alleged they were the victims of an “immigration scam” perpetuated by defendants wherein defendants falsely promised plaintiffs they would obtain legalization or citizenship documents for plaintiffs. Plaintiffs each paid defendants $15,000 but defendants did not deliver on their promises and refused to return plaintiffs’ money. The court dismissed the complaint, finding the underlying contract was illegal and thus unenforceable. On appeal, plaintiffs argue the court erred in dismissing their complaint because (1) illegality of contract is not a proper defense against the causes of action pled in their complaint; (2) illegality of contract is not a defense to the Consumer Fraud Act’s regulation of immigration service providers; and (3) the court’s public policy determinations were inconsistent with the public policy of the Illinois legislature and Illinois precedent. We reverse.\nBackground\nOn December 7, 2009, plaintiffs (individually referred to as Gamboa, Nava and Lopez) filed a five-count verified complaint against defendants alleging (count I) violations of the Consumer Fraud Act; (count II) common law fraud; (count III) unjust enrichment; (count IV) civil conspiracy; and (count V) intentional infliction of emotional distress. The following course of dealings between the parties is taken from plaintiffs’ complaint.\nIn early 2006, Alvarado told plaintiffs he could obtain “authentic citizenship documents” for plaintiffs through a contact at the United States Consulate office in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, and plaintiffs would be able to use the documents to obtain social security numbers. He stated his contact could influence both American and Mexican immigration officials to expedite the application process but would need to pay employees in the different departments to obtain the necessary releases. The cost for adjustments to legal permanent residency status would be $12,000 per person and to obtain United States citizenship would add an additional $3,000 per person.\nAlvarado stated he and his brother were obtaining their citizenship documents through the contact and invited plaintiffs to join their group. He explained that once the contact obtained the necessary documents, the group would travel across the Mexican border and pick up the documents at the consulate office after having photos and fingerprints taken and a short interview. If plaintiffs could get their money to him by the end of June 2006, they could have their documents by October. Otherwise, there would be a six-month delay.\nPlaintiffs each made payments totaling $15,000 to Alvarado over a period of months and received receipts from Marco’s Digital Photography in return for their payments. Alvarado explained he was providing receipts from his business to assure plaintiffs that the process was legitimate. Gamboa made some of his payments at Alvarado’s home and at Marco’s Digital Photography. Nava and Lopez alleged Alvarado used “high-pressure tactics” to get the payments by the June deadline, calling them weekly until they had paid in full. Nava did not make his final payment until October 2006. Alvarado informed plaintiffs that, because the deadline had not been met, there would be a delay and plaintiffs would not receive their documents until December 2006.\nIn February 2007, Alvarado told Gamboa that Gamboa’s documents were ready and Gamboa needed to make plane reservations to fly to El Paso in order to cross the border and get the documents. Gamboa went to Marco’s Digital Photography, where Alvarado “purchased” the reservations for $500 plus a $25 credit card fee. Shortly before Gamboa was to leave, Alvarado told him his Mexican contact would not be able to get the documents and the trip was cancelled. Alvarado refunded Gamboa’s $500 but not the $25 fee.\nPlaintiffs regularly called Alvarado inquiring about the status of their documents. Alvarado avoided plaintiffs. After repeated calls from plaintiffs, he told them that his contact had suffered a heart attack which would delay obtaining the documents. He gave Lopez his contact’s phone number in Mexico. Lopez spoke to the contact, “Jose de Jesus Castellanos,” who confirmed Alvarado’s version of heart-attack-induced delay. At some later point, Alvarado stated the delays were due to problems in Phoenix and El Paso, which “Castellanos” confirmed when Gamboa called him.\nIn March 2009, Alvarado met with plaintiffs and told them that there was nothing he could do for them. He stated they had all been swindled by Castellanos and it was necessary to bring legal action in Mexico. He requested plaintiffs each pay him $200 to hire a Mexican lawyer and sign a power of attorney. Lopez and Nava paid and signed the power of attorney. Gamboa refused and demanded his money back. Alvarado subsequently called Nava and Lopez, asking if they knew what Gamboa was planning and threatened them that if Alvarado “fell, they would all fall.”\nPlaintiffs pressed Alvarado to return their money. In September 2009, Alvarado told Nava and Lopez the lawsuit was no longer a viable option and explained his new plan was to hire thugs in Mexico to kidnap Castellanos and get the money back from Castellanos in return for Castellanos’ release. If Castellanos did not return the money, Alvarado implied the kidnappers would kill Castellanos. Nava and Lopez told Alvarado they were opposed to the violence and did not want to be part of the kidnapping scheme. On October 29, 2009, Alvarado told Nava and Lopez the kidnapping was on hold.\nPlaintiffs’ complaint alleged defendants engaged in numerous instances of unfair and deceptive practices in the conduct of trade or commerce in violation of section 2AA of the Consumer Fraud Act (815 ILCS 505/2AA (West 2008)), which governs private providers of immigration assistance services. Plaintiffs also alleged defendants committed common law fraud by inducing plaintiffs to rely on their misrepresentations; defendants were unjustly enriched by the monies plaintiffs paid them; defendants engaged in a civil conspiracy to defraud plaintiffs; and defendants intended to inflict emotional distress on plaintiffs by making the malicious statements that if Alvarado fell, they would all fall. Plaintiffs requested the court enjoin defendants from engaging in conduct relating to the provision of immigration services or in any of the deceptive practices charged and payment of assorted damages, including $45,000 to each plaintiff as the civil penalty provided for by section 2AA(m) (815 ILCS 505/2AA(m) (West 2008)).\nDefendants filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to section 2—619 of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2—619 et seq. (West 2008)). Defendants asserted that count I should be dismissed pursuant to section 2—619(a)(5) because it was not commenced within the three-year statute of limitations for causes of action arising under the Consumer Fraud Act. They asserted the entire complaint should be dismissed pursuant to section 2—619(a)(9) because the agreement between the parties was an illegal contract that violated the law and public policy and courts refuse to enforce a contract when the purpose of the contract violates the law.\nThe court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss on all counts on May 17, 2010. It filed an amended order granting defendants’ motion to dismiss on all counts on June 9, 2010, explaining “this Court finds the facts, as pleaded in Plaintiffs’ verified complaint, show that Plaintiffs and Defendants entered into an illegal contract that violates the law and public policy.” It declared the order final and appealable. Plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal from the court’s orders on June 9, 2010. The court having disposed of all matters before the court, we have jurisdiction to consider this timely appeal.\nAnalysis\nIllegality of Contract\nThe court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss as to all counts of the complaint pursuant to section 2—619(a)(9) of the Code, finding the facts as pleaded in the complaint showed the parties entered into an illegal contract that violates the law and public policy, and thus, per defendants’ argument, is unenforceable. Section 2—619(a)(9) of the Code permits involuntary dismissal where “the claim asserted against defendant is barred by other affirmative matter avoiding the legal effect of or defeating the claim.” 735 ILCS 5/2—619(a)(9) (West 2008); Van Meter v. Darien Park District, 207 Ill. 2d 359, 367 (2003). An “ ‘affirmative matter,’ in a section 2—619(a)(9) motion, is something in the nature of a defense” which, although the moving party admits the legal sufficiency of the complaint, negates the cause of action completely. Van Meter, 207 Ill. 2d at 367; Borowiec v. Gateway 2000, Inc., 209 Ill. 2d 376, 383 (2004); Neppl v. Murphy, 316 Ill. App. 3d 581, 584 (2000). The defect, defense or affirmative matter must be apparent on the face of the pleading attacked or be supported by affidavit. Borowiec, 209 Ill. 2d at 383.\nIn reviewing a grant of a motion to dismiss, we accept as true all well-pleaded facts in the plaintiff’s complaint, draw all reasonable inferences from those facts in favor of the plaintiff and interpret all pleadings and supporting documents in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Morr-Fitz, Inc. v. Blagojevich, 231 Ill. 2d 474, 488 (2008); Borowiec, 209 Ill. 2d at 383. As with an appeal from a grant of summary judgment, we must consider “whether the existence of a genuine issue of material fact should have precluded the dismissal or, absent such an issue of fact, whether dismissal is proper as a matter of law,” and we review a court’s grant of a section 2—619 motion to dismiss de novo. Kedzie &amp; 103rd Currency Exchange, Inc. v. Hodge, 156 Ill. 2d 112, 116-17 (1993); Borowiec, 209 Ill. 2d at 383.\nTaking the well-pleaded facts in plaintiffs’ complaint as true, there is no question that the verbal contract between defendants and plaintiffs was illegal. Indeed, defendants admit that the parties entered into a contact that violates Illinois and federal law and public policy. They correctly describe the parties’ agreement as a “scheme” wherein the five members of the group agreed to obtain their residency or citizenship documents “by circumventing the normal, legal process that the public follows in obtaining such documents” such as by paying bribes and paying off government officials in violation of assorted criminal codes. Courts will not enforce an illegal contract, a contract that expressly contravenes either Illinois or federal law and thus violates public policy. Kim v. Citigroup, Inc., 368 Ill. App. 3d 298, 307 (2006). Illegality of contract is, therefore, a defense to actions seeking enforcement of a contract. Kim, 368 Ill. App. 3d at 307. Arguably, therefore, the illegality of the contract between plaintiffs and defendants would be a defense to plaintiffs’ enforcement of the contract.\n•1 But plaintiffs are not seeking to enforce the contract. Rather, they are seeking to be reimbursed for the monies they paid defendants on the basis of the apparently fraudulent contract, costs they incurred as a result of the contract and assorted punitive damages, including those provided for by section 2AA of the Consumer Fraud Act. As the basis for plaintiffs’ claimed relief, they are asserting (1) violations of section 2AA of the Consumer Fraud Act; (2) common law fraud; (3) unjust enrichment; (4) civil conspiracy; and (5) intentional infliction of emotional distress. They do not, in any of these counts, seek enforcement of the agreement they had with defendants or assert a breach of contract claim. Illegality of contract, therefore, would not be a valid defense to plaintiffs’ claims.\nWe do not find, notwithstanding defendants’ argument to the contrary, that allowing plaintiffs to proceed with their claims would be tantamount to allowing them to enforce an illegal contact. Plaintiffs seek compensation for defendants’ actions in violating the Consumer Fraud Act and in misleading them, in promising something they had no ability or intent to deliver with full knowledge that plaintiffs would be harmed financially and emotionally by their actions. We do not find that allowing plaintiffs’ case to proceed would, as defendants assert, give “the parties’ meeting of the minds legitimacy.” Nor do we find that it will “send a message to those who lawfully engage in the process of obtaining immigration papers that if you do not accomplish your goal legally and through proper channels, then it is okay to do it by illegal means such as bribery and paying off corrupt officials within a government.” On the contrary, allowing plaintiffs’ claims to proceed will send a message to those unscrupulous individuals who mislead and prey on others by promising them immigration services they cannot deliver that there are ramifications for this antisocial behavior. These individuals cannot be allowed to use the very illegality of their agreement as a way to avoid the consequences of their actions.\nGranted, generally, “parties to a void contract will be left where they have placed themselves with no recovery of the money paid for il legal services.” Ransburg v. Haase, 224 Ill. App. 3d 681, 686 (1992). However, exceptions to this rule have been recognized where (1) the person who paid for the services was not in pari delicto (“in equal fault” ) with the offender and (2) the law in question was passed for the protection of the person who paid for the services and the purpose of the law would be better served by granting relief than by denying it. Ransburg, 224 Ill. App. 3d at 686.\nOn the facts as they stand now, it appears plaintiffs were not in pari delicto with defendants: plaintiffs spoke little English, did not know defendants were lying/unable to deliver on their promises and would not necessarily know the agreement was illegal or that, as will be described below, they had recourse under section 2AA. Further, section 2AA was clearly passed for the protection of persons such as plaintiffs and would be best served if plaintiffs are allowed to proceed with their claims.\nSection 2AA was created to deter the abuses allegedly committed by defendants here. In section 2AA, the General Assembly, given the substantial effect on the public interest of private individuals providing or offering to provide immigration assistance services, established rules of practice and conduct for such individuals in order to promote honesty and fair dealing with Illinois residents and preserve public confidence. 815 ILCS 505/2AA(a—1), (a—5) (West 2008). Licensed attorneys, legal interns under the direct supervision of a licensed attorney, not-for-profit organizations recognized by the Board of Immigration Appeals, employees of such organizations and certain organizations employing or seeking to employ an alien or nonimmigrant alien are exempt from the requirements of section 2AA. 815 ILCS 505/2AA(a—5) (West 2008). There is nothing to show defendants were exempt from section 2AA nor do they assert such.\nUnder section 2AA, any nonexempt person who provides or offers to provide immigration assistance service may perform only services such as translating and completing government forms, transcribing and/or translating responses to such forms, securing supporting documents, notarizing signatures and assorted other services. 815 ILCS 505/2AA(b) (West 2008). He may not make any statement that he “can or will obtain special favors from or has special influence with the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service or any other governmental agency” (815 ILCS 505/2AA(j)(1) (West 2008)); retain any compensation for service not performed (815 ILCS 505/2AA(j)(2) (West 2008)); provide legal advice, recommend a specific course of legal action or provide any other assistance that requires legal analysis, legal judgment or interpretation of the law or accept payment in exchange of such advice or assistance (815 ILCS 505/2AA(j)(2.5), (j)(5) (West 2008)); or “[m]ake any misrepresentation of false statement, directly or indirectly, to influence, persuade, or induce patronage” (815 ILCS 505/2AA(j)(6) (West 2008)).\nAny person perfoming any of the authorized services must register with the Illinois Attorney General and submit verification of malpractice insurance or a surety bond (815 ILCS 505/2AA(c) (West 2008)); provide the customer with a written contract explaining the services and costs in English and in the customer’s native language before performing any services (815 ILCS 505/2AA(d), (f) (West 2008)); and post a sign, a separate sign for each language in which he offers immigration assistance services, at his place of business stating he is not an attorney licensed to practice law and disclosing his fee schedule and assorted other information. 815 ILCS 505/2AA(e) (West 2008).\nPersons violating section 2AA shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor for a first offense and Class 3 felony for second or subsequent offenses. 815 ILCS 505/2AA(m) (West 2008). If the Attorney General or State’s Attorney fails to file an action under this section, any person may file a civil action to enforce the provisions of the section and maintain an action for injunctive relief or compensatory damages to recover prohibited fees. 815 ILCS 505/2AA(m) (West 2008). A prevailing plaintiff may be awarded three times the prohibited fees. 815 ILCS 505/2AA(m) (West 2008). Plaintiffs filed such a civil action here, seeking triple the amount they paid defendants pursuant to section 2AA(m).\nAgain taking the well-pleaded facts in plaintiffs’ complaint as true, there is no question that defendants were providers of immigration assistance services. There is also no question that they, as plaintiffs asserted in their complaint, violated section 2AA when they (1) failed to provide plaintiffs with a written contract explaining services to be performed and compensation to be charged in violation of section 2AA(d); (2) failed to provide plaintiffs with a written contract in English and Spanish, the language spoken by plaintiffs, in violation of section 2AA(f); (3) failed to post signs with the mandated disclosures at Marco’s Digital Photography in violation of section 2AA(e); (4) retained plaintiffs’ money after failing to obtain the promised documents, misrepresented to plaintiffs they could assist them in obtaining immigration documents and misrepresented that Castellanos was employed by the United States Consulate in Juarez, Mexico, in violation of section 2AA(j); and (5) failed to file the required registration statement or verification of malpractice statement or surety bond in violation of section 2AA(c).\nAs plaintiffs point out, defendants are essentially arguing that the very actions that section 2AA attempts to curtail can be used as a defense to claims brought under section 2AA. Section 2AA was passed for the protection of people such as plaintiffs. The purpose of section 2AA can best be effectuated by recognizing plaintiffs’ right to recovery. We find, therefore, that the court erred in dismissing plaintiffs’ complaint on the basis of illegality of contract.\nStatute of Limitations for Count I\n•2 In its order dismissing the complaint, the court did not mention defendants’ alternate argument for dismissal of count I. Defendants had argued, pursuant to section 2—619(a)(5) of the Code, that the Consumer Fraud Act count should be dismissed because it was filed beyond the three-year statute of limitations for filing such actions. Neither party raises this ground for dismissal on appeal, so we need not consider it. However, since it may come up again on remand and there is no merit to this argument, we will address it briefly.\nUnder section 2—619(a)(5), dismissal may be had upon a showing that the plaintiffs’ action was not commenced within the time limit provided by law. 735 ILCS 5/2—619(5) (West 1992); Streeter v. Chicago Transit Authority, 272 Ill. App. 3d 921, 923, 651 N.E.2d 579, 580 (1995). The statute of limitations for an action under the Consumer Fraud Act is three years and begins to run when the cause of action accrues. 815 ILCS 505/10a(e) (West 2008); Kopley Group V, L.P. v. Sheridan Edgewater Properties, Ltd., 376 Ill. App. 3d 1006, 1020-21 (2007). A cause of action that is not filed within the statute of limitations is time barred. 815 ILCS 505/10a(e) (West 2002); Kopley Group V., L.P, 376 Ill. App. 3d at 1021.\nPlaintiffs filed their cause of action on December 7, 2009. Accordingly, in order to meet the three-year statute of limitations for their Consumer Fraud Act claim, the claim had to accrue on or after December 7, 2006. Defendants asserted plaintiffs’ cause of action accrued in October 2006, when Nava made his final payment. We disagree.\nA cause of action under the Consumer Fraud Act accrues “ ‘when a person knows or reasonably should know of his injury and also knows or reasonably should know that it was wrongfully caused. At that point the burden is upon the injured person to inquire further as to the existence of a cause of action.’ ” (Emphasis omitted.) Kopley Group V, L.P, 376 Ill. App. 3d at 1021 (quoting Witherell v. Weimer, 85 Ill. 2d 146, 156 (1981)). Taking the well-pleaded facts in plaintiffs’ complaint as true for the purposes of the motion to dismiss, it is clear plaintiffs had no reason to know or suspect that they had been injured, let alone defrauded, in October 2006. Throughout the time that plaintiffs were making their payments, April 2006 through October 2006, Alvarado consistently called one or all of them, sometimes weekly, asking for the money. He told plaintiffs that if the June 2006 deadline for payment was missed, the documents would be delayed by up to six months, and he even used the supposed delay as a form of threat on occasion. There would be no reason for plaintiffs to suspect in October 2006 that they were the victims of fraud; they knew the June deadline had been missed and therefore would not expect any documents until December 2006, at the earliest. Alvarado reinforced this expectation when, after receiving the last “late” payment in October 2006, he told Gamboa that, due to the delay in payment, the documents would not be ready until November or December 2006. It was, therefore, reasonable for plaintiffs to continue thinking through December 2006 that their agreement with Alvarado would be honored.\nIt was not until sometime after December 2006, when plaintiffs still had not received the promised documents and Alvarado stopped responding to their phone calls, that plaintiffs might have had reason to suspect something was wrong, that Alvarado might not deliver on the agreements. It is not clear from plaintiffs’ complaint when such occurred, but it clearly occurred after December 2006, spanning a period of months, and ultimately years. Alvarado still strung Gamboa along as late as February 2007, when he told Gamboa he had to go to El Paso, “booked” Gamboa’s airline reservations and then cancelled his trip at the last minute. From mid-2007 through 2009, Alvarado sporadically gave plaintiffs additional excuses for his failure to procure the documents, put them in contact with Castellanos to verify the excuses, told them he’d been swindled too and much, much more. But, by that time, plaintiffs should have been aware that they had been injured and investigated further. Accordingly, we find plaintiffs’ cause of action under the Consumer Fraud Act accrued sometime in 2007, within the three-year statute of limitations for such actions.\nFor the reasons stated above, we reverse the order of the trial court and remand for further proceedings.\nReversed and remanded.\nBlack’s Law Dictionary 794 (7th ed. 1999).&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}]

Plaintiff alleged that defendant unlawfully imposed suspensions and fines on plaintiffs members when buses that they operated were photographed running red traffic lights. The circuit court granted defendant’s motion to dismiss the complaint under section 2—619 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2—619 (West 2008)), finding that a collective bargaining agreement, which contained a grievance and arbitration process, governed the dispute between the parties. We affirm.\nBACKGROUND\nOur recitation of the facts of this case is drawn from plaintiffs complaint, which we take as true when reviewing a motion to dismiss under section 2—619 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2—619 (West 2008)). See Coady v. Harpo, Inc., 308 Ill. App. 3d 153, 158-59 (1999).\nDefendant is a division of the Regional Transportation Authority, which provides public transportation in the Chicago area. Among other duties, defendant operates buses on routes throughout western Cook County. Plaintiff is a labor organization that is composed of and represents the collective interests of defendant’s employees, including bus drivers.\nBeginning in 2006, municipalities in western Cook County began installing “red light cameras” at intersections in their jurisdictions. Red light cameras work by automatically taking photographs of any vehicle that enters an intersection while the traffic signal in that direction is red. See 625 ILCS 5/11—208.6 (West 2008). Under authority granted to them by the Illinois Vehicle Code (625 ILCS 5/11—208.3(a) (West 2008)), these municipalities also created a system of administrative adjudication for violations of automated traffic laws (625 ILCS 5/11—208.6 (West 2008)). By statute, when red light cameras capture a violation, the municipality is required to mail written notice of the violation to the registered owner of the vehicle. See 625 ILCS 5/11—208.6(d) (West 2008). The notice must include copies of the photographs taken of the vehicle by the red light camera, as well as other information such as the date, time, and location of the alleged violation. See 625 ILCS 5/11—208.6(d)(1) through (d)(10) (West 2008). Registered owners may choose to pay the civil fine for the violation, or they may contest the violation at an administrative hearing. See 625 ILCS 5/11—208.6(d)(10) (West 2008). The only statutory defenses available to the registered owner at the hearing are either that the vehicle or its plates were reported as stolen before the alleged violation, or that the driver of the vehicle entered the intersection in order to yield to an emergency vehicle or as part of a funeral procession. See 625 ILCS 5/11—208.6(h) (West 2008). There are no provisions in the statute that anyone other than the registered owner of a vehicle is legally responsible for payment of a fine assessed under section 11—208.6.\nThis case arose when defendant began receiving traffic tickets for violations of section 11—208.6. Defendant learned from these notices that buses that it owned and operated had allegedly run red lights at intersections with red light cameras. According to the complaint, defendant began “effectively reassigning” these traffic tickets to the bus drivers who had been operating the vehicle at the time of the alleged violation. Under defendant’s alleged policy, defendant requires the bus driver to pay the fine and suspends the driver for between one and five days, with the possibility of termination of employment for three or more violations. The complaint alleges that defendant does not provide either the driver or plaintiff with a copy of the ticket or photographs of the alleged violation in a timely manner, which prevents the driver from contesting the charge.\nThe complaint asserted that defendant’s policy is illegal because, according to the Vehicle Code, only the registered owner of the vehicle is legally obligated to pay the fine, not the driver at the time of the alleged violation. Plaintiff sought a declaratory judgment that defendant’s practice of “reassigning” the traffic ticket to its employees is not justified by Illinois law and is ultra vires. Plaintiff further sought an injunction that would require defendant to give timely notice of any alleged violation of section 11—208.6 and would prohibit defendant from requiring its drivers to pay fines associated with the alleged violations.\nDefendant moved to dismiss the complaint under section 2—619(a)(9) of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2—619(a)(9) (West 2008)). In its motion, defendant argued that the parties had entered into a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), which contained a binding grievance and arbitration procedure for any disputes that arise under the CBA. Defendant contended that, although plaintiff framed its allegations in terms of unlawful “reassignment” of traffic tickets, plaintiffs complaint was in reality directed at the manner in which defendant disciplined its employees for on-the-job traffic violations. Defendant attached to its motion the four pages of the CBA that deal with the grievance process, as well as a clause that states, “[Plaintiff] agrees that it will not in any way interfere with or attempt to limit the right of [defendant] to discharge or discipline its employees for any reason where sufficient cause can be shown.” Defendant argued that, because the CBA deals with the specific issue that is in dispute, plaintiff must exhaust its contractual remedies under the CBA before bringing an action in the circuit court.\nAfter full briefing by the parties, the circuit court heard oral argument on January 21, 2010. The circuit court rejected plaintiffs arguments and agreed with defendant, stating “I don’t find [defendant’s] action here to be contradictory or in violation of the law. [Defendant] is acknowledging for purposes of the motion that they have a legal obligation to pay [the tickets]. I *** find that it is in fact a grievance related to the performance of the job duties and that the matter should be arbitrated under the terms of the collective bargaining agreement.” The circuit court granted defendant’s motion to dismiss with prejudice, and plaintiff filed a timely notice of appeal.\nANALYSIS\nOn appeal, plaintiff argues that the CBA does not cover the defendant’s actions and that this matter is therefore not required to go through the grievance and arbitration process spelled out in the CBA. Defendant counters that the trial court properly dismissed the complaint because defendant’s policy is related to the discipline of its employees, which is covered by the CBA.\nWe review an order of dismissal under section 2—619(a)(9) of the Code of Civil Procedure de novo, accepting as true all well-pled facts contained in the complaint and in any uncontradicted affidavits attached to the motion. See Coady v. Harpo, Inc., 308 Ill. App. 3d 153, 158-59 (1999). The question on review is “ ‘whether the existence of a genuine issue of material fact should have precluded the dismissal or, absent such an issue of fact, whether dismissal is proper as a matter of law.’ ” Doyle v. Holy Cross Hospital, 186 Ill. 2d 104, 110 (1999), quoting Kedzie &amp; 103rd Currency Exchange, Inc. v. Hodge, 156 Ill. 2d 112, 116-17 (1993).\nNeither party disputes the facts as they are laid out in the complaint, and neither party denies that the portion of the CBA that we have in the record is accurate and is binding upon the parties. Ordinarily, if a collective bargaining agreement exists and it contains a grievance and arbitration procedure, “an employee alleging a violation of the agreement must attempt to exhaust his or her contractual remedies before seeking judicial relief.” Kostecki v. Dominick’s Finer Foods, Inc., of Illinois, 361 Ill. App. 3d 362, 369 (2005). However, only “grievances” are subject to arbitration, and any claims that are not covered by the agreement may be pursued in the circuit court. See id. at 369-70. Consequently, the only question that we must decide on appeal is whether defendant’s policy of suspending drivers accused of red light camera violations and requiring them to pay the fines is a grievance within the meaning of the CBA.\nWe initially note that the portion of the CBA in the record does not contain a definition of the term “grievance.” However, “[e]n-grafted on every written contract are the customs, practices and definitions which are commonly understood and accepted by the parties.” Colgan v. Rae-Ann Electric Co., 91 Ill. App. 3d 386, 390 (1980). Our supreme court has noted that a grievance is generally understood to mean “any complaint by an employee concerning any aspect of the employment relationship.” City of Freeport v. Illinois State Labor Relations Board, 135 Ill. 2d 499, 530 (1990), quoting Roberts’ Dictionary of Industrial Relations 170-71 (1971). Because the employment relationship between the parties here is governed by the CBA, we take the term “grievance” to mean any dispute over the rights and obligations of the parties as they are defined by the CBA.\nOur first task is to determine the nature of the actions at issue. Plaintiff complains of three aspects of defendant’s policy: (1) suspending and possibly terminating drivers for alleged red light camera violations, (2) failing to give drivers sufficient notice of the allegations against them, and (3) requiring drivers to pay the fines for the red light camera violations. We find that the first portion of the policy is properly characterized as a disciplinary issue. The complaint itself alleges that defendant “disciplines Bus Operators [who are] reassigned red light tickets or citations by suspending them.” (Emphasis added.) Disciplinary actions are explicitly addressed in the CBA, in which plaintiff agreed not to interfere with defendant’s right to discipline or discharge its employees. Because suspension is a disciplinary matter and is therefore within the scope of the CBA, any dispute over this issue must be submitted through the CBA’s grievance process.\nThe second portion of the policy is also related to employee discipline. The complaint asserts that “Bus Operators have a right to timely notice of any traffic violations that they are alleged to have committed. [Defendant’s] practice, policy or custom *** deprives Bus Operators of the timely notice required. *** [Defendant’s] illegal practice, policy or custom has resulted in Bus Operators incurring and paying unjustified and increased fines and penalties as well as suspensions and other discipline.” (Emphasis added.) As noted above, defendant has a right to discipline its employees. However, the CBA explicitly limits defendant’s right only to situations where “sufficient cause can be shown.” The plain meaning of plaintiff’s allegation is that, by not providing sufficient notice of the alleged traffic violation to an employee, defendant has failed to demonstrate sufficient justification for imposing discipline on that employee. A dispute between the parties over whether defendant is disciplining its employees without sufficient cause is an issue that is explicitly covered by the CBA, and consequently, it must also be addressed through the CBA’s grievance process.\nThe third portion of the policy is more difficult to characterize. Plaintiff argues that defendant is the only entity that is legally obligated to pay red light camera citations and that its practice of “reassigning” the ticket to its bus drivers and forcing the bus driver to pay the ticket is illegal and ultra vires. “An ‘assignment’ is a transfer of property or some other right from one person (the ‘assignor’) to another (the ‘assignee’), which confers a complete and present right in the subject matter to the assignee. An assignment is a contract between the assignor and the assignee, and is interpreted or construed according to the rules of contract construction.” 6 Am. Jur. 2d Assignments §1 (2008). Common law and statutory rights are generally assignable, absent a clear statute or public policy to the contrary. See 6 Am. Jur. 2d Assignments §7 (2008). Plaintiff characterizes defendant’s policy of requiring bus drivers to pay the red light ticket as an “assignment,” and it sought a judicial declaration that such an assignment is void as against public policy.\nHowever, we find that defendant’s policy is not an assignment. Even assuming, without deciding, that a red light camera citation is assignable, there is no indication in the complaint that an assignment has occurred in this case. Plaintiff does not indicate that there is any contract of assignment between defendant and the bus drivers who are accused of running red lights, and without such an agreement there can be no assignment. Indeed, the complaint does not allege that an assignment occurred at all. Instead, the complaint merely alleges that defendant is “effectively reassigning” (emphasis added) the citations, indicating that no assignment in the legal sense has occurred.\nMoreover, the bus drivers themselves do not appear to actually pay the fine to municipalities. If an assignment of a red light camera citation had occurred, then the bus driver would be obligated to pay the fine directly to the municipality. That does not appear to be the case here. Rather, it seems that defendant pays the fine, and then defendant requires bus drivers to reimburse it for the amount paid to the municipality. The complaint specifically alleges that defendant has “demanded that the employee Bus Operators pay for the red light tickets or citations” and that defendant “has in fact collected payments from Bus Operators after demanding that they pay red light camera violations.” (Emphasis added.)\nBased on plaintiffs own allegations, defendant does not “assign” the red light citation to its employees. Rather, defendant’s policy is that its employees must reimburse it for the citations that it is obligated to pay to municipalities due to red light camera violations. There is consequently no transfer of a right or an obligation from defendant to its employees, meaning that no assignment of the traffic citation has occurred. As a result, we find that defendant’s action is properly characterized as disciplinary in nature because it imposes a monetary sanction on the employee for an alleged violation of a traffic law to the detriment of defendant. As a disciplinary matter, defendant’s practice of fining employees for red light camera violations falls under the CBA, and any dispute over this issue must be submitted through the grievance process.\nAlthough we find that each component of defendant’s policy is covered by the CBA and therefore must be addressed through the CBA’s grievance procedures, plaintiff contends that the circuit court may still address plaintiffs claims because they exist independently of the CBA. Plaintiff relies on three cases for this proposition, but we find that each of these cases is distinguishable.\nFirst, plaintiff relies on Semmens v. Board of Education of Pontiac Community Consolidated School District No. 429, 190 Ill. App. 3d 174 (1989). In Semmens, a group of teachers claimed that they had been unlawfully denied a duty-free lunch period of at least 30 minutes each day, in violation of section 24—9 of the School Code (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. 122, par. 24—9). See Semmens, 190 Ill. App. 3d at 176. The circuit court granted the defendant’s motion to dismiss on the ground that a collective bargaining agreement between the teachers and the school district required arbitration of any dispute before the Illinois Educational Labor Relations Board. See id. The collective bargaining agreement contained a section entitled “Lunch Period,” but the section was completely blank. See id. at 177. The appellate court reversed, finding that the collective bargaining agreement did not address the lunch period issue and that arbitration therefore was not mandatory. See id. at 181.\nUnlike Semmens, the CBA in the instant case deals directly with discipline of employees. The CBA does not contain any specific clauses that specify what offenses an employee may be disciplined for, but this fact does not take the issue of discipline itself outside the scope of the CBA. The collective bargaining agreement in Semmens demonstrably failed to address the issue of a lunch period. In contrast, the parties’ present dispute is whether and how an employee may be disciplined for a red light camera citation, which is an issue that falls within the discipline clause of the CBA. We consequently find that Semmens is distinguishable.\nSecond, plaintiff cites Daniels v. Board of Education of the City of Chicago, 277 Ill. App. 3d 968 (1996). In Daniels, the plaintiffs sued to recover the value of accrued vacation days that they had not been able to use prior to being laid off by the defendant. See id. The trial court dismissed the complaint because the plaintiffs had not first exhausted their remedies under their collective bargaining agreement, which contained a section outlining how vacation days accumulate. See id. The appellate court reversed, finding that, although the collective bargaining agreement did address the issue of vacation days, the plaintiffs’ cause of action did not arise under the agreement. See id. at 972. Instead, the court found that the plaintiffs had an independent statutory right to compensation for unused vacation days under the Illinois Wage Payment and Collection Act (820 ILCS 115/5 (West 1992)).\nUnlike Daniels, there is no independent statutory right at issue here. Plaintiff argues that its action for declaratory judgment and an injunction arises from section 11—208.6 of the Vehicle Code (625 ILCS 5/11—208.6 (West 2008)), which requires a municipality to issue a citation for a red light camera violation to “the registered owner of the vehicle as the alleged violator.” 625 ILCS 5/11—208.6(d) (West 2008). We do not agree with plaintiffs analysis. There is no indication in the complaint that defendant has caused any municipality to illegally issue a citation to an individual who is not the registered owner. Indeed, defendant acknowledges that it has a legal obligation to pay the fines because it owns the vehicles accused of violating section 11—208.6. Despite plaintiffs contentions, its cause of action arises from defendant’s alleged violation of the disciplinary clause of the CBA, not independently from a state statute. Daniels is therefore distinguishable.\nFinally, plaintiff relies on Croom v. City of De Kalb, 71 Ill. App. 3d 370 (1979). In Croom, the plaintiff firefighters sought an injunction that would require the defendant to abide by an arbitration clause in their collective bargaining agreement during a dispute over additional pay for performing certain duties. See id. at 370-71. The agreement did not contain any provision that dealt with additional pay, and both the circuit court and the appellate court found that the parties had therefore not agreed to arbitrate that issue. See id. at 376.\nWe find Croom to be distinguishable for two reasons. First, the arbitration clause in Croom mandated arbitration only for grievances over express provisions of the collective bargaining agreement. See id. at 375. Because the question of additional pay was not expressly addressed in the agreement, it was therefore not subject to arbitration. See id. at 375-76. Unlike Croom, the CBA in the instant case requires all grievances that “arise under” the CBA to be submitted through the grievance process. This language is significantly broader than in Croom, and therefore a broader category of grievances than those expressly mentioned in the CBA are subject to arbitration. Second, discipline of defendant’s employees is explicitly within the scope of the CBA, which is the opposite factual situation as that in Croom and which therefore requires a different result. Croom is consequently distinguishable.\nCONCLUSION\nDefendant’s policy of imposing suspensions and fines on employees accused of red light camera violations is a disciplinary matter. Additionally, the issue of the sufficiency of notice that defendant provides to its employees regarding alleged red light camera violations is a dispute over defendant’s method of disciplining its employees. Because defendant’s right to discipline its employees is a grievance that is within the scope of the CBA, it is subject to the grievance and arbitration process specified in the CBA. Plaintiff did not exhaust its contractual remedies under the CBA prior to bringing the instant action in the circuit court, and as a result, the circuit court properly dismissed the complaint.\nAffirmed.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}]

Epstein &amp; Sons International, Inc. (Epstein), appeals the judgment of the circuit court of Cook County granting defendant, Eppstein Uhen Architects, Inc.’s (EUA) motion for summary judgment pursuant to section 2—1005 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2—1005 (West 2008)) and denying Epstein’s motion for partial summary judgment. We reverse the judgment of the circuit court granting EUA’s motion for summary judgment and affirm the circuit court’s judgment denying Epstein’s motion for partial summary judgment. We find that the terms in the parties’ first alleged contract are ambiguous and require the aid of extrinsic evidence to determine the parties’ intent. Therefore, summary judgment was not proper.\nJURISDICTION\nOn April 24, 2009, the circuit court entered its final judgment denying Epstein’s motion to reconsider. On May 22, 2009, Epstein filed its notice of appeal. Accordingly, this court has jurisdiction pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rules 301 and 303 governing appeals from final judgments entered below. Ill. S. Ct. R. 301 (eff. Feb. 1, 1994); R. 303 (eff. May 30, 2008).\nBACKGROUND\nIn December of 2002, Franciscan Communities, d/b/a St. Joseph Home of Chicago, hired EUA to provide professional design services for a construction project in Chicago, Illinois. EUA then called upon Epstein to submit a proposal for it to provide engineering design services for Franciscan’s construction project. Epstein submitted a signed proposal on November 6, 2002, and EUA accepted it by signing it on December 2, 2002. Displeased with EUA’s performance on its construction project, Franciscan filed an arbitration demand against EUA in December of 2007. In turn, EUA filed an arbitration demand upon Epstein in January 2008, asserting claims arising out of Franciscan’s arbitration demand.\nEpstein filed a petition to stay arbitration and complaint for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief in May of 2008. Epstein attached two documents to its petition that are at the center of the dispute between the parties. The first document, titled “MEPFP Engineering Services Proposal” is dated November 6, 2002 (November document). The second document attached to Epstein’s petition is dated December 9, 2002, and titled “Architect-Consultant Agreement” (December document). The dispute is whether Epstein is bound by an arbitration provision which is set out in a third unattached document, AIA Document C141 — 1997 (AIA provision) that the December document purports to incorporate by reference.\nThe November document described the project; outlined the engineering design services, administrative services, and structural engineering services plaintiff agreed to provide and in what manner; as well as set out fees and expenses. The November document also attached and incorporated terms and conditions of service. The terms and conditions of service state that EUA will be bound by the terms of the November document once it is executed. Furthermore, any modifications to those terms must be made in writing. Nothing in the November document mentions that disputes between the parties will be resolved in arbitration. The relevant provisions of the November document’s terms and conditions of service are as follows:\n“1. These Terms and Conditions of Services are an integral part of the Proposal dated November 6, 2002 between [Epstein] and [EUA],\n2. *** Upon execution of this Proposal by [EUA] ***, [EUA] shall be bound by the Proposal and all of these Terms and Conditions of Service ***. Any additions, deletions, or changes to the Proposal or these Terms and Conditions of Services shall be in writing and executed by both Parties.\n3. (a) The services described in the Proposal constitute the Scope of Services that Epstein agrees to provide to [EUA] under this Agreement.\n(c) If, during Epstein’s performance of the Scope of Services, [EUA] requests, in writing, a change in the Scope of Services ***, such Change in Service and method of compensation shall be agreed to in writing prior to Epstein being obligated to undertake such Change in Service. If Epstein performs such Change in Service and this Subparagraph (c) has not been complied with, Epstein shall be compensated at its then prevailing hourly rates.\n(d) The Scope of the Project is set forth in the Proposal. The scope of the Project shall not be altered without the written consent of both Epstein and [EUA]. In the event that the parties consent to alter the scope of the Project, the Scope of Services and the fees and charges for the Project as set forth in this Agreement shall be adjusted in accordance with subparagraph (c) of this Paragraph 3.\n* * *\n21. This Agreement constitutes the entire integrated Agreement between [EUA] and Epstein, and supercedes all prior negotiations, representations, or agreements, whether written or oral except as are specifically incorporated into this Agreement by reference. This Agreement may not be amended except by written instrument signed by both [EUA] and Epstein.\n22. This Agreement shall he governed by the laws of the State of Illinois.”\nEpstein signed the November document on November 6, 2002, and EUA signed it on December 6, 2002.\nThe December document stated that Epstein agreed to provide “Civil, Structural, and MEP-FP engineering consulting design services” for a fixed fee of $275,000. The December document also outlines how the construction documents are to be produced and stored, as well as billing and insurance provisions. Most importantly, the December document referenced an unattached document, the AIA provision, that requires disputes between the parties to be settled by arbitration. The December document provides in pertinent part as follows:\n“Said Engineering Services shall be provided in accordance with the requirements set forth in the AIA Document C141—1997 Standard Form of Agreement Between [EUA] and [Epstein] in its entirety (Pages 1-14) for the engineering service disciplines named above including such additional amendments as listed below:\nA. Consulting services shall be as specified in [Epstein’s] letter dated November 6, 2002.”\nEUA signed the December document on December 9, 2002, and Epstein signed it on December 16, 2002. Although not attached to the December document originally, Epstein attached the AIA provision to its petition, which in relevant part provided:\n“§9.2.1 Any claim, dispute or other matter in question arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be subject to arbitration. Prior to arbitration, the parties shall endeavor to resolve disputes by mediation ***.”\nIn its petition, Epstein alleged that it only signed the December document because it was told by EUA’s project manager that the December document was necessary in order to process payments to Epstein. Epstein alleged that the December document identified the same scope of services as the November document, the fees were the same, and EUA did not provide any consideration for Epstein’s agreement to submit to arbitration. In count I of its petition, Epstein sought a stay of arbitration pursuant to section 2 of the Illinois Uniform Arbitration Act (710 ILCS 5/2(b) (West 2008)), alleging that the November document did not contain any provisions compelling arbitration. In count II of its petition, Epstein sought a declaratory judgment, requesting the circuit court enter a judgment declaring that the November document “is the agreement between Epstein and EUA governing the provision of services by Epstein on the project” and that the December document “does not constitute a valid and binding modification” to the November document and that the November document does not require disputes between the parties to be submitted to arbitration.\nOn November 10, 2008, EUA filed a motion for summary judgment. 735 ILCS 5/2—1005 (West 2008). In its motion, EUA alleged that its arbitration demand was based solely on the December document and that it is irrelevant that the November document does not contain an arbitration clause. EUA alleged further that because the arbitration demand was based solely on the December document, and not the November document, there is no ripe case or controversy between the parties relative to the November document. Epstein responded that the December document is not a valid and binding agreement because it lacks consideration, namely, that EUA has not shown how Epstein received any benefit from the December document that it had not already received in the November document. Epstein responded further that even if the December document is the controlling agreement between the parties, it does not contain an express agreement to arbitrate. Instead, Epstein argues that the December document is ambiguous. EUA replied that the December document is not ambiguous and that it contained adequate consideration, namely, a flat fee of $275,000, the agreement to arbitrate, as well as insurance and indemnification provisions. EUA replied that the plain language of the December document incorporated the AIA provision and that even if the November document is considered a contract between the parties, the December document is a valid modification of the November document.\nAlso on November 10, 2008, Epstein filed its own motion for partial summary judgment as to count I of its petition seeking a determination by the circuit court that the December document’s reference to the AIA provision is not sufficient to obligate Epstein to submit to arbitration. In doing so, Epstein did not concede that the December document was the operative agreement between the parties, but rather sought a determination that as a matter of law, there is nothing in the December document that would compel arbitration. EUA responded that the plain language of the December document shows an agreement between the parties to submit to arbitration. In its reply, Epstein maintained that the December document does not require it to submit to arbitration because the reference in the December document to the AIA provision was for the limited purpose of describing engineering services that Epstein was required to provide, not to compel arbitration.\nOn January 30, 2009, the circuit court denied Epstein’s motion for partial summary judgment and granted EUA’s motion for summary judgment. The circuit court found the December document to be the governing contract between the parties and held that the December document contained an agreement to arbitrate. The circuit court reasoned that the November document appeared to be a proposal between the parties. Additionally, the circuit court found that the December document’s language was clear and unambiguous that the AIA provision was to be incorporated into the agreement in its entirety. On April 24, 2009, the circuit court denied Epstein’s motion to reconsider the circuit court’s grant of summary judgment in favor of EUA as to count II of Epstein’s petition. Epstein timely appeals.\nANALYSIS\nOn appeal, Epstein argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment. As to count I, Epstein argues summary judgment was improper because the December agreement’s terms on the AIA provision are ambiguous. As to count II, Epstein argues summary judgment was improper because a genuine issue of material fact remained in dispute, namely, which document controlled. Epstein contends the circuit court’s finding that the December document was the only agreement between the parties concerned a disputed issue of material fact not appropriately decided at the summary judgment stage. EUA, on the other hand, argues that the circuit court properly entered summary judgment in its favor because the December document is the operative agreement between the parties and its terms requiring arbitration are clear and unambiguous.\nSummary judgment is proper where “the pleadings, depositions, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.” 735 ILCS 5/2—1005(c) (West 2008). In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, the circuit court is to determine whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, not try a question of fact. Williams v. Manchester, 228 Ill. 2d 404, 417 (2008). When determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the pleadings are to be liberally construed in favor of the nonmoving party. Id. We recognize that “[although summary judgment can aid in the expeditious disposition of a lawsuit, it remains a drastic means of disposing of litigation and, therefore, should be allowed only where the right of the moving party is clear and free from doubt.” Id. We review summary judgment rulings de novo. Id.\nAn instrument’s legal effect is not “to be determined by the label which it bears or the technical terms it contains.” Bonde v. Weber, 6 Ill. 2d 365, 377 (1955). Rather, it is the intention of the parties that governs. Illinois Central R.R. Co. v. Michigan Central R.R. Co., 18 Ill. App. 2d 462, 474 (1958). When determining whether a document is a binding contract, we must consider whether the three basic elements of a contract are present, namely, an offer, acceptance, and consideration. Steinberg v. Chicago Medical School, 69 Ill. 2d 320, 329 (1977). “Consideration consists of some detriment to the offeror, some benefit to the offeree, or some bargained-for exchange between them.” Doyle v. Holy Cross Hospital, 186 Ill. 2d 104, 112 (1999). However, “if the alleged consideration for a promise has been conferred prior to the promise upon which alleged agreement is based, there is no valid contract.” Johnson v. Johnson, 244 Ill. App. 3d 518, 528 (1993).\nIn reviewing the language of a contract, the “circuit court must initially determine, as a question of law, whether the language *** is ambiguous as to the parties’ intent.” Quake Construction, Inc. v. American Airlines, Inc., 141 Ill. 2d 281, 288 (1990). Where the terms of a contract are clear and unambiguous, the parties’ intent must be derived solely from the document. Id. If the terms of the alleged contract are ambiguous or capable of more than one interpretation, parole evidence is admissible tó determine the parties’ intent. Id. Suftimary judgment is not proper where a purported contract contains ambiguous terms, which require admission of extrinsic evidence to interpret them. Loyola Academy v. S&amp;S Roof Maintenance, Inc., 146 Ill. 2d 263, 272 (1992).\nThe circuit court’s finding that the December document controlled was primarily determined by the fact that the November document is titled “proposal.” EUA’s briefed position was that the November document is a proposal, not a contract. At oral argument, EUA admitted that the proposal was an executed binding contract and our analysis continues with that being a given. Both the November and December documents cannot be reconciled on the issues as to the requirement of arbitration. Epstein maintains that the December document was a formality to insure proper payment, not a modification of the November agreement. EUA argues that the December document is the controlling contract as it modified the November agreement. The intent of the parties is ambiguous, and therefore, parole evidence must be considered in determining the parties’ intent behind these documents. Accordingly, summary judgment is not appropriate. Loyola Academy, 146 Ill. 2d at 272 (summary judgment not appropriate where an alleged contract is ambiguous and parole evidence is needed to interpret the intent of the parties).\nSummary judgment is also not appropriate because the November document raises other fact issues that need to be addressed at trial. Specifically, if the November document is a valid contract, whether the December document is supported by sufficient consideration such that it is a proper modification of that contract is an issue of fact. Epstein argues that any alleged consideration in the December document was illusory because the fee in the December document is the same fee in the November document. EUA argues that the December agreement contains different consideration from that provided in the November document, namely, that EUA agrees to pay Epstein a flat fee of $275,000. The November document contains a fee of approximately $200,000 and a fee structure for expenses. It is not clear if the November document and the December document contain the same fee once expenses are added. This is a genuine issue of material fact that precludes summary judgment. If, as Epstein alleges, the December document was not based on any new consideration, then the December document would not be a valid contract. See Johnson, 244 Ill. App. 3d at 528. In construing the pleadings against EUA as the movant, the issue of consideration is a material fact that is disputed by the parties and, thus, also precludes summary judgment.\nA review of the record shows that before the circuit court, EUA maintained that the November document was a proposal, as opposed to an agreement between the parties. EUA additionally briefed that as fact in its response to this appeal. However, at oral argument, EUA conceded that the November document was in fact an agreement between the parties. This discrepancy concerns us. The circuit court may well have ruled differently had the court had the benefit of the concession of the November document being an agreement between the parties as opposed to a proposal. Due to this discrepancy, as well as the need for the aid of extrinsic evidence to determine the intent of the parties, summary judgment is not proper in this case.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court of Cook County is affirmed in part and reversed in part and the cause is remanded.\nAffirmed in part and reversed in part; cause remanded.\nEpstein’s petition included a count III, but Epstein voluntarily dismissed this count on August 29, 2008.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}]

On March 16, 2007, the circuit court of Du Page County entered an order dissolving the 25-year marriage of the parties, Bruce and Cecily Schinelli. The trial court divided the marital estate evenly, factoring in against Bruce’s share a charge for dissipation in the amount of $26,273. The trial court ordered permanent maintenance to Cecily in the amount of $6,692 per month. Additionally, the trial court ordered additional maintenance to Cecily in the amount of one-third of Bruce’s annual gross income between $200,000 and $650,000 (supplemental maintenance). Bruce appealed from that order. In the first appeal, Bruce argued that the trial court erred in (1) setting the amount of permanent maintenance; (2) ordering supplemental maintenance; and (3) finding that he dissipated $26,273 in marital assets. This court affirmed the trial court’s order of permanent maintenance but reversed the trial court’s order capping the supplemental maintenance range at $650,000 and instead capped it at $250,000. As to dissipation, this court affirmed a finding of dissipation of $2,625; we reversed a finding of $5,729; and we remanded for a new hearing to determine whether Bruce dissipated the remaining $17,919 withdrawn from the parties’ joint tax-exempt money-market account. In re Marriage of Schinelli, No. 2 — 07—0617 (2008) (unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23) (Schinelli I).\nOn remand, the trial court entered three orders from which Bruce now appeals. Bruce contends that the trial court erred in (1) awarding Cecily $15,000 in attorney fees for defending the first appeal; (2) finding that he had dissipated $17,919 of marital assets; and (3) entering a “Qualified Domestic Relations Order” (QDRO) that improperly modified the judgment of the dissolution of marriage. For the following reasons, we reverse and remand for additional proceedings.\nThe record in this case is substantial. A great deal of evidence was presented in the trial court. Therefore, only those facts necessary to an understanding of this court’s decision will be set forth below, and the relevant facts will be discussed in the analysis of the issues to which they are pertinent.\nAward of Attorney Fees\nOn August 21, 2008, Cecily filed a petition for contribution of fees and costs incurred in the previous appeal. Cecily sought reimbursement for attorney fees of $30,570.07 and costs of $272.81. The petition was supported by an affidavit from Cecily’s attorney regarding his firm’s fees. The petition was not supported by any affidavit from Cecily. On December 11, 2008, following a hearing, the trial court ordered Bruce to pay $15,000 of Cecily’s attorney fees. The trial court explained that if Bruce had appealed only the issue of supplemental maintenance, he would have prevailed and no contribution to fees would be warranted. However, since Bruce had also appealed the award of permanent maintenance and dissipation, the trial court held that contribution was appropriate.\nOn appeal, Bruce argues that the trial court’s decision to award Cecily $15,000 in attorney fees was against the manifest weight of the evidence. Bruce contends that Cecily failed to show that she had an inability to pay her own fees. Bruce further argues that the trial court erred in determining that Cecily was entitled to a portion of her fees because she substantially prevailed on the first appeal.\nAt the outset, we consider Cecily’s argument that we do not have jurisdiction over Bruce’s first contention. Cecily notes that when the trial court entered its order awarding her attorney fees, the trial court indicated that its order was final. Cecily contends that, because the trial court’s order was final, Bruce should have filed his appeal within 30 days rather than waiting for the trial court to resolve the other postjudgment petitions that had been filed in the case. As Bruce did not, Cecily argues that we may not consider the propriety of the award of attorney fees. In so arguing, Cecily acknowledges that her contention is inconsistent with this court’s decisions in In re Marriage of Alyassir, 335 Ill. App. 3d 998 (2003), and In re Marriage of Duggan, 376 Ill. App. 3d 725 (2007). However, she urges this court to overrule Alyassir and to instead adopt the analysis set forth in the special concurrence in Duggan.\nIn In re Marriage of Gutman, 232 Ill. 2d 145, 151 (2008), our supreme court recently explained:\n“ ‘An order is final and appealable if it terminates the litigation between the parties on the merits or disposes of the rights of the parties, either on the entire controversy or a separate part thereof.’ R.W. Dunteman Co. v. C/G Enterprises, Inc., 181 Ill. 2d 153, 159 (1998). Absent a Rule 304(a) finding, a final order disposing of fewer than all of the claims is not an appealable order and does not become appealable until all of the claims have been resolved. Marsh v. Evangelical Covenant Church of Hinsdale, 138 Ill. 2d 458, 464 (1990). This court has defined a ‘claim’ as ‘any right, liability or matter raised in an action.’ Marsh, 138 Ill. 2d at 465. The rule was meant ‘to discourage piecemeal appeals in the absence of a just reason and to remove the uncertainty which existed when a final judgment was entered on fewer than all of the matters in controversy.’ Marsh, 138 Ill. 2d at 465.”\nHere, the trial court’s order awarding Cecily attorney fees did not include a finding pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 304(a) (eff. Jan. 1, 2006). Thus, pursuant to Gutman, the trial court’s order was not appealable until all of the other claims had been resolved. As Bruce properly filed his notice of appeal after the trial court had resolved all of the claims pending between the parties, this court has jurisdiction over the issue of the award of attorney fees. See Gutman, 232 Ill. 2d at 151. In so ruling, we note that our supreme court’s decision is consistent with our decisions in Alyassir and Duggan. We therefore decline Cecily’s invitation to revisit either of those cases.\nTurning to the merits of Bruce’s first contention, we note that attorney fees are generally the responsibility of the party who incurred the fees. In re Marriage of Cantrell, 314 Ill. App. 3d 623, 630 (2000). Section 508(a) of the Illinois Marriage and Dissolution of Marriage Act (the Dissolution Act) (750 ILCS 5/508(a) (West 2008)) provides in part:\n“The court from time to time, after due notice and hearing, and after considering the financial resources of the parties, may order any party to pay a reasonable amount for his own or the other party’s costs and attorney’s fees.” 750 ILCS 5/508(a) (West 2008).\nThe propriety of an award of attorney fees is dependent upon a showing by the party seeking them of an inability to pay and the ability of the other spouse to do so. Cantrell, 314 Ill. App. 3d at 630. Although awarding fees rests largely in the trial court’s discretion, such an award will be reversed when the financial circumstances of both parties are substantially similar and the party seeking fees has not shown an inability to pay. In re Marriage of Roth, 99 Ill. App. 3d 679, 686 (1981).\nHere, the trial court abused its discretion in ordering Bruce to pay $15,000 of Cecily’s attorney fees. The record reveals that Bruce earned substantially more than Cecily. He earned approximately $200,000 a year while Cecily earned approximately $30,000 a year. However, in dissolving the parties’ marriage, the trial court attempted to rectify this difference, ordering that Bruce pay Cecily permanent monthly maintenance of $6,692 ($80,304 a year). Thus, considering the combination of Cecily’s annual salary and her maintenance award ($30,000 + $80,000 = $110,000) in conjunction with Bruce’s salary and his maintenance obligations ($200,000 - $80,000 = $120,000), the parties’ financial circumstances were substantially similar. Based on this fact, and because Cecily did not demonstrate that she was unable to pay her attorney fees, the trial court erred in ordering Bruce to pay those fees. See id.\nIn so ruling, we find Cecily’s reliance on In re Marriage of Minear, 181 Ill. 2d 552, 561 (1998), to be misplaced. In that case, the wife had monthly net income of $1,086 and also received monthly maintenance of $500 (for a total of $1,586 a month). The husband’s monthly net income, after making the maintenance payment, was $2,563. At a hearing on her motion to have the husband pay her attorney fees, the wife testified that she could not pay her legal fees and that she could not afford to continue paying $675 in monthly mortgage payments. The trial court subsequently awarded the wife her attorney fees. In this case, Cecily’s maintenance award was substantially higher than the wife’s in Minear. Moreover, unlike the wife in Minear, Cecily did not provide evidence that she could not afford to pay her own legal fees.\nFurther, Cecily acknowledges that her trial counsel pointed out at the hearing that “substantially prevailed” was not a question before the court. Indeed, section 508(a) of the Dissolution Act makes no reference to attorney fees being awarded to the party who substantially prevailed in previous litigation. See 750 ILCS 5/508(a) (West 2008).\nDissipation\nAt the trial on March 1, 2007, Cecily’s attorney questioned Bruce about withdrawals he had made from the parties’ joint USAA tax-exempt money-market account. Bruce testified that he routinely transferred funds from the account to their joint checking account to pay marital bills. As to certain withdrawals, he testified that he did not know why he withdrew the money and did not have any documents to refresh his recollection. The trial court did not allow Bruce’s attorney to question Bruce regarding those withdrawals. At the close of the trial, the trial court found that Bruce had dissipated assets. On appeal, this court reversed a finding of dissipation as to $17,919 and remanded for a new hearing so that Bruce could have the opportunity to present evidence that the expenditures made from the joint money-market account between February 2006 and February 2007 were for marital purposes. We also stated:\n“In so ruling, we note that although Bruce was not able to testify as to the withdrawals during his case-in-chief, there was evidence to rebut a determination that Bruce dissipated any funds. The evidence showed that while the dissolution proceedings were pending and the parties were living apart, Bruce paid household expenses for the marital residence, his own household expenses, and all [of the parties’ son] Ian’s personal and educated-related [sic] expenses. Bruce’s [comprehensive financial statement] showed that his monthly income after deductions was $8,652 and that his total monthly expenses were $10,163. Accordingly, Bruce was operating at a monthly deficit of $1,511. Accordingly, withdrawing funds from the joint money market fund in the amount of $17,919 ($26,273 minus the funds spent on [Bruce’s girlfriend] Gallo and the funds to pay off the joint credit card) over the course of twelve months seems reasonable. A $1,511 monthly deficit over a twelvemonth period results in a total deficit of $18,132, which is approximately the amount withdrawn by Bruce. Bruce testified that the parties’ bills were traditionally paid out of the parties’ joint checking account. He further testified that he routinely transferred funds from the joint money market account to the checking account when the parties’ expenses exceeded the balance in the checking account.” Schinelli I, slip op. at 21-22.\nOn April 27, 2009, on remand, the trial court conducted a hearing. Bruce testified that he had withdrawn a total of $17,919 from the parties’ joint USAA tax-exempt money-market account and then deposited that money in the parties’ joint USAA checking account. These withdrawals and deposits were made on nine occasions. Bruce presented documents that reflected the first eight of the withdrawals and subsequent deposits. He did not have any document that reflected the last withdrawal, of $2,000 on February 9, 2007. However, he testified that he deposited that money into the joint checking account to prevent that account, which had a balance of $799.72 on February 13, 2007, from being overdrawn. (The judgment of dissolution found that the checking account had a value of $2,270 on March 1, 2007.) Bruce also testified that he deposited over $6,000 from one of his personal accounts into the joint checking account.\nAs to withdrawals from the checking account, Bruce introduced into evidence the checking account statements. These statements detailed every deposit and every ATM, check, transfer, or debit-card withdrawal after the deposits from the money-market account were made. Bruce testified regarding the withdrawals. Bruce testified that from January 2006 through March 2007, he was primarily responsible for paying household expenses for the former marital residence in Naperville. The expenses were paid using electronic transfers from either his personal USAA checking account or the joint USAA checking account. He paid Cecily’s housing expenses with the joint USAA checking account. Between January 2006 and March 2007, in addition to Cecily’s household expenses, he paid the expenses of establishing his own residence, his general living expenses (gas, food, and clothes), and his son Ian’s personal and college expenses. In 2006 and early 2007, Ian’s college expenses, for Belmont University in Tennessee, cost about $2,700 a month.\nDuring the time frame at issue, Bruce’s monthly gross earnings were $16,717. His monthly expenses for both households and Ian’s schooling were over $10,000. The parties had a joint USAA credit card which both of them used in 2006. He paid the credit card bill in full each month through one of the two accounts. He and Cecily each had a debit card for the joint USAA checking account, which he used occasionally in 2006 through early 2007. Most of the debit transactions were hers. Bruce testified that this was apparent because most of the transactions occurred close to where Cecily lived in Naperville. He lived in Wheeling. Bruce testified that he transferred funds occasionally from the joint USAA tax-exempt money-market account into the joint USAA checking account to cover living expenses over and above their incomes.\nCecily testified that from January 2006 through March 2007 she lived at the former marital residence. She worked at Oak Consulting in Lisle and her pay was directly deposited twice a month into the joint USAA checking account. Her monthly net income from her employment was $1,048. Her mortgage, utility, food, and other household expenses totaled $3,330 and were paid by Bruce. He paid the real estate taxes from the joint checking account. She paid the monthly cable and cell phone bills from the joint checking account. Her personal expenses of $711 per month and clothing expenses were charged to the parties’ joint USAA credit card. The joint USAA credit card bill was paid from their joint checking account. Her monthly miscellaneous expenses totaled $804 and were also paid from the joint checking account.\nCecily acknowledged that she traveled to Florida in January 2006, Tennessee in November 2006, and Las Vegas in December 2006. None of the trips were work-related. She used the joint credit card while she was on those trips. She also acknowledged that she had used the joint checking account to make payments to her attorneys. (The record reveals that Cecily used the joint credit card to pay her attorneys $5,079.51 between January 2006 and February 2007.) She further acknowledged that she made ATM withdrawals from the joint checking account. (The record indicates that she made withdrawals of $1,409.95.)\nAt the close of the hearing, the trial court ruled that Bruce had failed to show by clear and convincing evidence that he had not dis sipated marital assets from the joint checking account. The trial court explained:\n“The Appellate Court did specifically say, Counsel, that you were supposed to prove by clear and convincing evidence how the money went. I don’t have any canceled checks showing what he paid, I don’t have anything. I looked — I can clearly see that he made — he put money into the account. That’s clear. I understand how much he was putting into the account.\nBut he was retaining the rest of the money that he earned. You offered not one piece of evidence today that showed what bills he paid with the remainder of his money: No lease, no rent, no expenses, no car, no gas, no dental bills, nothing that you offered into evidence today.\nI do think that clearly he did transfer money into the account. I saw that. When his income went up to the $200,000, it didn’t appear that his deposits into this account went up.\nI have to look at the amount of money that he was retaining over and above what he was putting in before, he kept it at the same amount, and then he didn’t account for how he spent the rest of the money.\nI don’t think you met the burden that the Court required of you to meet. I thought it was really clear, and I expected to get that evidence in today, and I didn’t get one piece of it.\n* * *\nThe remaining seventeen nine one nine, I still find it to be dissipation, I still find that you failed to meet your burden by clear and convincing evidence to show how the funds were spent, not that they weren’t deposited, I understand they were deposited.”\nIn Schinelli I, this court explained:\n“Dissipation has been defined as the use of marital property for the sole benefit of one of the spouses for a purpose unrelated to the marriage at a time when the marriage is undergoing an irreconcilable breakdown. In re Marriage of Vancura, 356 Ill. App. 3d 200, 203 (2005). The determination of whether dissipation occurred in a given case is reviewed using the manifest weight of the evidence standard of review. Vancura, 356 Ill. App. 3d at 204. The general principle is that the person charged with the dissipation is under an obligation to establish by clear and convincing evidence how the funds were spent. Vancura, 356 Ill. App. 3d at 204. General statements that funds were spent on marital expenses or to pay bills are inadequate to avoid a finding of dissipation. In re Marriage of Petrovich, 154 Ill. App. 3d 881, 886 (1987).” Schinelli I, slip op. at 16.\nWe believe that the trial court erred in finding that Bruce had dissipated assets from the joint checking account. In Schinelli I, we remanded for the trial court to conduct a new hearing on whether Bruce had dissipated $17,919 from the joint checking account and to allow him to present evidence on that issue. Although the trial court conducted a hearing and allowed Bruce to present evidence of how funds in the joint checking account had been spent, the trial court’s ruling was unrelated to the evidence presented. Instead, the trial court essentially found that Bruce should have been paying the family’s bills with one of his individual accounts rather than the joint account. That was improper. See In re Marriage of Davis, 215 Ill. App. 3d 763, 778 (1991) (although husband had other funds available to him, he was not required to use those funds, before using marital funds, for family purposes).\nAs we noted in Schinelli I, when Bruce was allegedly dissipating marital assets, he was paying household expenses for the marital residence, his own household expenses, and all of Ian’s personal and education-related expenses. These substantial expenses caused Bruce to incur a monthly deficit of $1,511. At the hearing on remand, Bruce testified that the parties’ bills were traditionally paid out of the parties’ joint checking account. At that same hearing, the parties’ statements from the joint checking account were introduced into evidence. Bruce testified in detail regarding the transactions and whether he or Cecily had made each transaction and why it had been made. Bruce further testified that he deposited over $6,000 from one of his individual accounts into the joint checking account. Based on the evidence adduced at the original trial in conjunction with the evidence presented at the hearing on remand, the record shows that Bruce established by clear and convincing evidence that he did not dissipate marital assets. The trial court’s finding to the contrary was therefore against the manifest weight of the evidence.\nIn so ruling, we reject Cecily’s argument that Bruce presented only vague and general testimony as to how the funds were spent. We believe that Bruce’s testimony and other evidence sufficiently set forth how the funds from the parties’ joint checking account were spent. We also reject Cecily’s argument that Bruce essentially admitted that he dissipated $816.50 that he withdrew by ATM and $2,119.99 that he paid to his attorneys. The record reveals that during the time frame at issue, Cecily paid her attorneys fees of $5,079.51. She made ATM withdrawals of $1,409.95. She also used the joint checking account to pay expenses incurred on personal trips to Florida, Tennessee, and Las Vegas. As such, Cecily was making the same types of withdrawals from the joint checking account that she criticizes Bruce for making. Based on these circumstances, we believe that it would be inequitable to find that Bruce dissipated assets and to overlook Cecily’s similar conduct.\nQualified Domestic Relations Order\nIn its judgment of dissolution on March 16, 2007, the trial court evenly divided the parties’ retirement assets. The trial court awarded each party his or her own retirement assets. The one exception was Bruce’s Wachovia 401(k) account. The trial court divided that asset so that the overall division of the marital retirement assets would be equal. Specifically, the trial court’s order provided:\nAsset\nTTX Thrift Plan\nWachovia 401(k)\nWachovia Deferred Comp.\nSchwab IRA\nSchwab IRA\nSchwab IRA\nOak Consultants 401(k)\nTotal\nEquity\n$5,418\n$309,423\n$62,665\n$49,128\n$27,732\n$27,118\n$66,670\n$548,224\nBruce\n$5,418\n$156,901\n$62,665\n$49,128\n0\n0\n0\n$274,112\nCecily\n0\n$152,522\n0\n0\n$27,732\n$27,118\n$66,670\n$274,112\nOn November 18, 2008, Cecily filed a motion for a QDRO based on the dissolution order. She requested that $152,522 be transferred from the Wachovia 401(k) account to her. Bruce filed a written objection, stating that the value of the plan had dropped drastically due to market conditions. He therefore argued that a transfer to Cecily of the amount originally ordered was no longer appropriate.\nOn April 27, 2009, the trial court conducted a hearing on Cecily’s motion. The evidence established that as of March 31, 2009, the Wachovia 401(k) account had a value of $179,830. In response to comments by the parties as to its intent in dividing the retirement accounts, the trial court explained:\n“I added them all up, divided them by two. She kept hers, he kept his, except for the 40 IK for him, he would have to roll over money into her. So that, when they all ended up at the bottom, they had the same amount.\n* * *\nThe Wachovia 40 IK was the vehicle designated to be the one that money would come out of his so that, when it went into hers, they would each have the same total for all of their accounts.”\nBruce’s attorney argued that Cecily’s QDRO should be for half of what the Wachovia 401(k) was currently worth. The trial court questioned whether it could reevaluate one of the parties’ retirement accounts without reevaluating all of the other retirement accounts that had been divided. Cecily’s attorney argued that the dissolution order provided that she was to receive $152,522 from the Wachovia 401(k); thus, that is the amount she should receive. At the close of the hearing, the trial court ordered that $152,522 (84.8% of the Wachovia 401(k) account’s value) be awarded to Cecily.\nOn appeal, Bruce argues that the trial court erred in entering a QDRO that improperly modified the dissolution order. Bruce contends that the trial court’s dissolution order intended that the parties’ retirement assets be divided equally between them. However, the effect of the QDRO was to award Cecily an additional $125,000. Bruce insists that the QDRO was improper because it caused him to bear all of the loss that the Wachovia 401(k) account suffered between March 2007 and March 2009. Bruce maintains that, in entering the QDRO, the trial court should have divided the Wachovia 401(k) account loss between them in a way that was consistent with its judgment of dissolution.\nJudgments may be construed like other written instruments. In re Marriage of Breslow, 306 Ill. App. 3d 41, 57 (1999). For instance, although an unambiguous judgment must be enforced as drafted, an ambiguous judgment may be read in conjunction with the entire record and construed in accordance therewith. Id.\nHere, the problem with the dissolution order is not that it is ambiguous; the problem is that it is unenforceable. The dissolution order unambiguously provided that Bruce was to receive $156,901 from the Wachovia 401(k) account and that Cecily was to receive $152,522 from the Wachovia 401(k) account. When the trial court entered the QDRO on April 27, 2009, the dissolution order was impossible to comply with because the Wachovia 401(k) account was worth only $179,830. We therefore believe that the trial court’s resolution of this issue — to have Bruce bear all the loss that the Wachovia 401(k) account incurred — is both unfair and contrary to the judgment of dissolution. Accordingly, the trial court’s decision must be reversed.\nIn arguing that she should nonetheless receive the full $152,522, despite the diminution in the Wachovia 401(k) account, Cecily relies on In re Marriage of Carrier, 332 Ill. App. 3d 654 (2002). We find Cecily’s reliance on that case to be misplaced. In Carrier, the parties had a marital settlement agreement that provided that the wife would receive $725,000 from the husband’s individual retirement account (IRA) via a QDRO. Prior to the entry of the dissolution judgment, the trial court conducted a proveup of the settlement agreement. At the proveup, the husband testified that he understood that the wife was to receive $725,000 from his IRA regardless of whether the market value of the account rose or fell following the entry of the dissolution judgment. On June 14, 2000, the trial court entered a judgment of dissolution that was consistent with the parties’ marital settlement agree ment. On November 27, 2000, the wife filed a petition for a rule to show cause, alleging that the husband had failed to transfer to her the $725,000. On February 21, 2001, the trial court conducted a hearing on the wife’s petition. Several correspondences between the parties were introduced that indicated that, until September 28, 2000, the wife had taken on the responsibility to effectuate the transfer from the IRA. The husband testified that the account was currently worth $120,000 less than it was when the parties’ marriage was dissolved. The husband also testified that he believed the parties were to divide the IRA on a percentage ratio. Thus, because the value of the account had gone down, he asserted that the value of the wife’s share had also decreased. At the close of the hearing, the trial court found that for the period between September 1, 2000, and September 28, 2000, each of the parties should assume a proportion of the loss in accordance with his or her ratio of interest. Id. at 655-57. On appeal, this court vacated the trial court’s decision. Id. at 662. We found that the marital settlement agreement unambiguously stated that the wife was to receive $725,000. Because the marital settlement agreement did not indicate that the wife’s award from the IRA was to be based on a percentage or to be affected by subsequent fluctuations in market value, we held that the trial court erred in ruling that the wife’s share of the IRA was affected by the change in the market value of the account between the dissolution judgment and the date of transfer. Id. at 658. In a dissent, one justice wrote the trial court’s decision allocating the market losses between the parties should be affirmed. Id. at 662 (O’Malley, J., dissenting). The dissent explained that because the wife was responsible for the transfer of the funds during a certain time frame, “it would be patently unfair to saddle [the husband] with the loss incurred during that period of time.” Id. at 663 (O’Malley, J., dissenting).\nHere, unlike in Carrier, the parties did not have a marital settlement agreement that divided their marital assets. As such, unlike the husband in Carrier, Bruce never agreed that Cecily would receive a fixed amount from the retirement account at issue. Rather, the parties’ retirement assets were divided by the trial court. In the absence of any marital settlement agreement providing that Cecily would receive a set amount, we believe that it would be patently unfair to saddle one of the parties with all of the losses incurred in the Wachovia 401(k) account. Accordingly, as stated above, we believe that the trial court erred in allocating all of that loss to Bruce.\nCecily insists that the trial court’s decision may nonetheless be affirmed because Bruce failed to introduce evidence as to whether the value of the other retirement assets had fluctuated. Relying on In re Marriage of Brenner, 235 Ill. App. 3d 840, 848 (1992), Cecily contends that the trial court was obligated to reevaluate all of the retirement assets in order to ensure that they were properly divided. Because Bruce did not present the value of the other assets, Cecily argues that he has forfeited his right to any relief.\nGenerally, if a property division is reversed based on an improper valuation, then the proper remedy is to reverse the property settlement in the judgment and remand the case for reevaluation and redivision of all the marital assets. In re Marriage of Rubinstein, 145 Ill. App. 3d 31, 38 (1986). The parties to a dissolution must provide the trial court with sufficient evidence of property value. Brenner, 235 Ill. App. 3d at 848. A reviewing court will not reverse and remand where the parties had adequate opportunity to present evidence but failed to do so. Id.\nHere, we do not believe that the trial court had to reevaluate any of the parties’ assets other than the Wachovia 401(k) account. In Rubinstein, at issue was the trial court’s improper determination of the value of the husband’s medical practice. Rubinstein, 145 Ill. App. 3d at 38. That determination necessarily impacted the division of the parties’ other marital assets as well as the amount of support that the husband should pay the wife. In this case, neither the trial court nor the parties indicated that the division of the Wachovia 401(k) account had any impact on the division of the parties’ marital estate other than how the parties’ retirement assets were distributed. Indeed, Cecily does not fault Bruce because he failed to present evidence of all of the parties’ marital assets; she faults him only because he did not present evidence of the current value of the parties’ retirement assets that had previously been divided.\nBased upon how the retirement assets were divided, however, we do not believe that the trial court was obligated to reassess those assets. In its order of dissolution on March 16, 2007, the trial court awarded Cecily a 100% interest in three accounts that had a total value of $121,520. The trial court awarded Bruce a 100% interest in three accounts that had a total value of $117,211. Thus, excluding the Wachovia 401(k) account, the trial court awarded Cecily 50.9% of the retirement accounts and Bruce 49.1% of those accounts. As such, the trial court essentially awarded each party an equal amount of the retirement accounts.\nAs the parties were awarded these accounts upon the entry of the judgment of dissolution, they were then able to manage the accounts as conservatively or aggressively as they wanted. Thus, the parties were given the ability to minimize their accounts’ losses during the stock market decline that occurred in 2008. This was markedly differ ent from the situation with the Wachovia 401(k) account. Because that account was subject to a QDRO, neither party could exercise any discretion over that account until the first appeal was resolved.\nWe believe that if the trial court were obligated to reconsider the value of the other retirement accounts before it addressed how the Wachovia 401(k) losses should be allocated, it would lead to a potentially unfair result. If the other accounts were considered, the party who managed his or her accounts better during the market decline would have to subsidize the party who incurred more losses with his or her investment strategy in order to ensure that the accounts continued to be divided equally. As this would be improper, contrary to Cecily’s assertion, Bruce was under no obligation to provide the trial court with evidence as to whether the retirement assets previously distributed had fluctuated in value.\nFinally, we note that in dividing the Wachovia 401(k) account, the trial court’s March 16, 2007, dissolution order had the effect of awarding 50.7% of the Wachovia 401(k) account to Bruce and 49.3% of the account to Cecily. As the trial court’s QDRO of April 27, 2009, was not consistent with the order of dissolution, we reverse the QDRO. On remand, the trial court shall enter a QDRO consistent with its dissolution order, awarding 50.7% of the Wachovia 401(k) account to Bruce and 49.3% of the account to Cecily. The value of the Wachovia 401(k) account shall be based on what it would currently be worth had it not been divided on April 27, 2009.\nConclusion\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court of Du Page County is reversed and the cause is remanded for additional proceedings consistent with this decision.\nReversed and remanded with directions.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}]
[{&#39;author&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE BOWMAN&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE BOWMAN\ndelivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\nJustices Hudson and Birkett concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nOPINION\nPlaintiffs, Travel Express Aviation Maintenance, Inc., and Travel Express Aviation, LLC, appeal from the trial court’s dismissal of their claims against defendants Bridgeview Bank Group, f/k/a Uptown National Bank (Bridgeview), and Royal Palm Aviation, LLC (Royal Palm). At issue is whether plaintiffs or Bridgeview had priority in their claims against an aircraft originally owned by defendant Fasti USA, Inc. (Fasti). The trial court effectively determined that Bridge-view, whose claim against the plane predated plaintiffs’ claims by several years, was not required to file a continuation statement with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to maintain the perfection of its claim. Therefore, Bridgeview’s claim retained its priority. We affirm.\nI. BACKGROUND\nAround May 2001, Bridgeview loaned money to Fasti. In return, Bridgeview received a promissory note and a security agreement giv ing it a security interest in a 1979 Cessna aircraft that Fasti owned. On July 9, 2001, Bridgeview recorded the security agreement with the FAA. Fasti breached the security agreement on August 18, 2008, and Bridgeview repossessed the plane on October 7, 2008. On April 8, 2009, Bridgeview issued a notice to plaintiffs, among others, of a private Uniform Commercial Code (810 ILCS 5/1 — 101 et seq. (West 2008)) sale of the aircraft, to take place on April 20, 2009. Royal Palm purchased the plane, and the bill of sale was recorded with the FAA on June 22, 2009.\nMeanwhile, on February 14, 2005, plaintiffs filed a lien statement with the FAA for $55,000 worth of work they had completed on the plane for Fasti by December 30, 2004. On October 1, 2008, plaintiffs filed a lien statement with the FAA for $36,272.68 worth of work they had completed on the plane for Fasti by September 11, 2008.\nOn September 10, 2009, plaintiffs filed a complaint to foreclose on their liens. The complaint contained six counts. Counts I through III related to the $36,272.68 lien. Count I was directed against all three defendants and sought a judgment foreclosing the lien; count II was directed against Bridgeview and sought an accounting; and count III was directed against Fasti and alleged breach of contract. Counts IV through VI related to the $55,000 lien. Count IV was directed against all three defendants and sought a judgment foreclosing the lien; count V was directed against Bridgeview and sought an accounting; and count VI was directed against Fasti and alleged breach of contract.\nBridgeview filed a motion to dismiss on October 22, 2009. Bridge-view sought to dismiss counts I and IV of plaintiffs’ complaint, pursuant to section 2 — 619 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) (735 ILCS 5/2 — 619 (West 2008)). It argued, inter alia, that its security interest had priority over plaintiffs’ lien claims. Bridgeview further sought to dismiss counts II and V pursuant to section 2 — 615 of the Code (735 ILCS 5/2 — 615 (West 2008)), arguing that plaintiffs failed to state a claim for an accounting because they did not allege that they had an inadequate remedy at law. On December 28, 2009, the trial court granted Bridgeview’s motion and dismissed the counts against it. It further sua sponte dismissed counts I and IV as to Royal Palm and Fasti. The trial court included language under Supreme Court Rule 304(a) (Ill. S. Ct. R. 304(a) (eff. Jan. 1, 2006)) that there was no reason to delay the enforcement or appeal of the order. Plaintiffs timely appealed.\nII. ANALYSIS\nOn appeal, plaintiffs challenge the trial court’s grant of Bridge-view’s motion to dismiss. In reviewing the grant of a section 2 — 619 motion, we must interpret the pleadings and supporting materials in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. Abruzzo v. City of Park Ridge, 231 Ill. 2d 324, 332 (2008). A section 2 — 619 dismissal resembles the grant of a motion for summary judgment; we must determine whether a genuine issue of material fact should have precluded the dismissal or, absent such an issue of fact, whether the dismissal was proper as a matter of law. Raintree Homes, Inc. v. Village of Long Grove, 209 Ill. 2d 248, 254 (2004). A section 2 — 615 motion to dismiss attacks the legal sufficiency of the complaint. We must determine whether the allegations, when construed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, sufficiently state a cause of action upon which relief can be granted. Turner v. Memorial Medical Center, 233 Ill. 2d 494, 499 (2009). A cause of action should not be dismissed under section 2 — 615 unless no set of facts can be proved entitling the plaintiff to recover. Id. We review de novo the grant of a motion to dismiss under either section 2 — 615 or section 2 — 619. Westfield Insurance Co. v. Birkey’s Farm Store, Inc., 399 Ill. App. 3d 219, 231 (2010).\nThis case further requires us to interpret statutes. The primary rule of statutory construction is to give effect to the legislature’s intent, which is best determined by the statutory language’s plain and ordinary meaning. Solon v. Midwest Medical Records Ass’n, 236 Ill. 2d 433, 440 (2010). We will not read into the language any exceptions, limitations, or conditions that conflict with the expressed intent. Id. at 441. Statutory construction presents a question of law, which we review de novo. Id. at 439.\nPlaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in finding that Bridgeview was not required to file a continuation statement with the FAA to maintain perfection of its security interest in the aircraft. Federal law requires that every aircraft transfer be evidenced by an instrument recorded with the FAA before the rights of innocent third parties can be affected. 49 U.S.C. §§44107, 44108 (2006); Philko Aviation, Inc. v. Shacket, 462 U.S. 406, 409-10 (1983). Section 44107 of the Federal Aviation Administration Act requires the FAA’s administrator to establish a system for recording, among other things, “conveyances that affect an interest in civil aircraft of the United States.” 49 U.S.C. §44107(a)(1) (2006). “Conveyance” is defined as “an instrument, including a conditional sales contract, affecting title to, or an interest in, property.” 49 U.S.C. §40102(a)(19) (2006). Section 44108 of the Federal Aviation Administration Act provides in relevant part:\n“(a) Validity Before Filing. — Until a conveyance, lease, or instrument executed for security purposes that may be recorded under section 44107(a)(1) or (2) of this title is filed for recording, the conveyance, lease, or instrument is valid only against—\n(1) the person making the conveyance, lease, or instrument;\n(2) that person’s heirs and devisees; and\n(3) a person having actual notice of the conveyance, lease, or instrument.\n(b) Period of Validity. — When a conveyance, lease, or instrument is recorded under section 44107 of this title, the conveyance, lease, or instrument is valid from the date of filing against all persons, without other recordation, except that [exceptions not applicable.]\n* * *\n(c) Applicable Laws. — (1) The validity of a conveyance, lease, or instrument that may be recorded under section 44107 of this title is subject to the laws of the State, the District of Columbia, or the territory or possession of the United States at which the conveyance, lease, or instrument is delivered, regardless of the place at which the subject of the conveyance, lease, or instrument is located or delivered.” (Emphasis added.) 49 U.S.C. §44108 (2006).\nThe federal registration process was designed to create a central clearing house to record titles so that everyone has easy access to claims, liens, or legal interests in a civilian aircraft. Philko Aviation, Inc., 462 U.S. at 411. Therefore, in creating the registration system, Congress intended that it “preempt any state law under which a transfer without a recordable conveyance would be valid against innocent transferees or lienholders who have recorded.” Id. at 410. In this case, it is undisputed that Bridgeview properly recorded its security interest in Fasti’s aircraft on July 9, 2001.\nPlaintiffs rely on Illinois’s Uniform Commercial Code (Commercial Code) (810 ILCS 5/1 — 101 et seq. (West 2008)). The Commercial Code requires the in-state filing of a financing statement to perfect a security interest, but this requirement does not apply to, among others, “property subject to a statute, regulation, or treaty described in Section 9 — 311(a).” 810 ILCS 5/9 — 310(b)(3) (West 2008). Section 9 — 311(a)(1) provides in relevant part:\n“(a) Security interest subject to other law. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) [not applicable here], the filing of a financing statement is not necessary or effective to perfect a security interest in property subject to:\n(1) a statute, regulation, or treaty of the United States whose requirements for a security interest’s obtaining priority over the rights of a hen creditor with respect to property preempt Section 9 — 310(a)[.]” 810 ILCS 5/9 — 311(a)(1) (West 2008).\nThus, the Commercial Code also recognizes that any federal statutory requirements would prevail for perfecting a security interest in property, and the Commercial Code exempts parties with such security interests from its filing requirements. In fact, the official comments to section 9 — 311 specifically mention the registry for civilian aircrafts as an example of the type of federal statute referred to in subsection (a)(1). 810 ILCS Ann. 5/9 — 311, Uniform Commercial Code Comment, at 510 (Smith-Hurd 2004).\nPlaintiffs do not dispute that under Illinois law Bridgeview’s security interest originally had priority over their liens due to Bridgeview’s earlier perfection of its security interest. See 770 ILCS 45/4 (West 2008) (lien “shall be subject to the lien of any bona fide security interest as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code upon the same chattel recorded prior to the commencement of any lien herein created”). Rather, plaintiffs argue that Bridgeview was required under the Commercial Code to file a continuation statement with the FAA to maintain perfection of its security interest and that its failure to do so resulted in plaintiffs’ liens having priority. Section 9 — 515 of the Commercial Code provides that a filed financing statement is effective for five years and that a continuation statement must be filed for the financing statement to remain effective for another five years. 810 ILCS 5/9 — 515 (West 2008). However, section 9 — 311(c) of the Commercial Code provides that “duration and renewal of perfection of a security interest perfected by compliance with the requirements prescribed by a statute, regulation, or treaty described in subsection (a) are governed by the statute, regulation, or treaty.” (Emphasis added.) 810 ILCS 5/9 — 311(c) (West 2008). Thus, in addition to the Supreme Court’s holding that federal law preempts state law in the area of recording a security interest in a civilian aircraft, the Commercial Code expressly defers to federal law on the subject of the duration and renewal of perfection of a security interest. As stated, section 44108, governing filing with the FAA, states that “[w]hen a conveyance, lease, or instrument is recorded under section 44107 of this title, the conveyance, lease, or instrument is valid from the date of filing *** without other recordation.” (Emphasis added.) 49 U.S.C. §44108(b) (2006). Accordingly, we agree with defendants that under the unambiguous language of the relevant statutes, Bridgeview was not required to file a continuation statement to maintain the perfection of its security interest in the aircraft.\nPlaintiffs argue that federal law does not absolutely preempt state law concerning interests in an aircraft. Plaintiffs note that priority is determined under state law (see Philko, 462 U.S. at 412-13 (all interests in aircraft “must be federally recorded before they can obtain whatever priority to which they are entitled under state law”) ), as is validity (see 49 U.S.C. §44108(c) (2006) (the “validity of a conveyance, lease, or instrument that may be recorded under section 44107 *** is subject to the laws of the State *** at which the conveyance, lease, or instrument is delivered”)). Plaintiffs argue that a dispute over whether a continuation statement needs to be filed by a party with an interest in a civilian aircraft for that party to maintain perfection is a “priority” dispute. Plaintiffs argue that although section 9 — 311(c) of the Commercial Code provides that the “duration and renewal” of a security interest perfected under a federal statute is governed under that statute, section 44108 is silent as to duration and renewal, so that subject would still be governed by state law, which requires the filing of a continuation statement. Plaintiffs maintain that all that is meant by section 44108’s language that an “instrument is valid from the date of filing against all persons, without other recordation” is that: (1) the date of filing, rather than the date the FAA actually records the instrument, determines the date of perfection, and (2) an instrument filed with the FAA need not also be filed with a state or local recording office.\nPlaintiffs’ argument is without merit. The necessity of a continuation statement is a question not of priority, as plaintiffs characterize it, but rather of maintaining the perfection of a recorded security interest. Even if the phrase “without other recordation” in section 44108 is construed to mean that an instrument does not need to be filed with a state or local recording office, the Commercial Code indisputably defers to federal law on the subject of the “duration and renewal of perfection of a security interest” in an aircraft (810 ILCS 5/9 — 311(c) (West 2008)), and section 44108 still provides that an “instrument is valid from the date of filing against all persons,” without listing any applicable exceptions (49 U.S.C. §44108 (2006)). To revert to the Commercial Code on the issue of a continuation statement would be reading into both the federal and the state statutes exceptions and conditions that do not exist, contrary to the rules of statutory construction. Thus, once Bridgeview filed its security inter est with the FAA, the interest was perfected without the need to renew or extend its duration.\nPlaintiffs’ reliance on In re Brice, 188 F.3d 576 (4th Cir. 1999), does not compel a different result. In that case, two creditors received security interests in the same aircraft in exchange for loans. As in this case, the junior creditor, Thomas Blair, argued that the senior creditor, Crestar Bank, had forfeited its priority because it failed to file a continuation statement with the FAA five years after it filed its initial security agreement. Id. at 577. In addition to a statute requiring a continuation statement, Virginia had a statute similar to section 9 — 311 of the Commercial Code which provided that “ ‘[djuration and renewal of perfection of a security interest perfected by compliance with the statute or treaty [of the United States] are governed by the provisions of the statute or treaty.’ ” Id. at 578 n.4 (quoting Va. Code Ann. §8.9 — 302(4) (Michie 1991)). The bankruptcy court held that section 44107 of the Federal Aviation Administration Act preempted the state law requiring a continuation statement and that therefore Crestar Bank was not required to file such a statement with the FAA. The district court affirmed. Id. at 577. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals also affirmed, though on a different basis. It relied on section 55 — 100 of the Virginia Code, which provided:\n“ ‘No instrument which affects the title to or interest in any civil aircraft of the United States, as defined by federal law, ... shall be valid ... until such instrument is recorded in the office of the Civil Aeronautic[s] Administrator of the United States, or such other office as is designated by the laws of the United States as the one in which such instruments should be filed. Every such instrument so recorded in such office shall be valid as to all persons without further recordation in any office in this Commonwealth, the provisions of any other recordation statute to the contrary notwithstanding.’ ” (Emphasis added.) Id. at 578 n.5 (quoting Va. Code Ann. §55 — 100 (Michie 1995)).\nThe court of appeals held that section 55 — 100 applied because the security interest concerned an aircraft registered with the FAA, and under section 55 — 100, no further recordation was required after the initial FAA filing. Id. at 579.\nPlaintiffs argue that since the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals analyzed the issue under state law and relied on a statute not present in Illinois, it is reasonable to conclude that the court believed that the bank would not have otherwise been exempt from filing a continuation statement. However, in choosing to affirm the lower courts’ decisions on a different basis, the court of appeals neither rejected nor accepted their analysis. Furthermore, the court of appeals interpreted the phrase “without further recordation” in section 55 — 100 as not requiring additional recordation beyond the initial recordation with the FAA, and this phrase is almost the same as section 44108(b)’s statement that a security agreement is valid from the date of filing “without other recordation.”\nBased on the plain reading of the relevant statutes, Bridgeview’s security interest in the aircraft remained perfected upon its initial recordation and retained its priority over plaintiffs’ later-recorded liens. When Bridgeview sold the plane to Royal Palm, plaintiffs’ liens on the plane were extinguished. See 810 ILCS 5/9 — 617(a)(3) (West 2008) (“[a] secured party’s disposition of collateral after default *** discharges any subordinate security interest or other subordinate lien”). Therefore, the trial court properly granted Bridgeview’s motion to dismiss counts I and IV Plaintiffs’ arguments requesting a reversal of the dismissal of counts II and V are also premised on the position that Bridgeview’s perfection of its security interest lapsed due to the lack of a continuation statement. In rejecting this position, we affirm the dismissal of counts II and V as well. The remaining counts, counts III and VI, alleged breach of contract against Fasti and are not before us on appeal. Based on our resolution of the issues, we need not address defendants’ argument that plaintiffs’ liens were invalid because they were filed with the FAA rather than in the county in which the work was done. See 770 ILCS 45/2 (West 2008).\nIII. CONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court of Kane County.\nAffirmed.\nFor purposes of this appeal, we do not differentiate between Travel Express Aviation Maintenance, Inc., and Travel Express Aviation, LLC.\nThe Philko court used the example that a party recording its interest with the FAA may still not have an enforceable interest in the plane if the instrument evidencing the transfer to the party did not comply with formal requisites of state law. Philko, 462 U.S. at 414 n.8; see also In re Gary Aircraft Corp., 681 F.2d 365, 372-75 (5th Cir. 1982) (although holder of security interest recorded with the FAA its interest in two planes before the subsequent purchaser did, purchaser was a buyer in the ordinary course of business under Texas law and therefore bought the planes free of the security interest).&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}]
[{&#39;author&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE STEWART&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &quot;JUSTICE STEWART\ndelivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\nJustice Welch concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nJustice Spomer dissented, with opinion.\nOPINION\nOn October 24, 2002, the plaintiff, James Wisniewski, filed a complaint against the defendant, the Catholic Diocese of Belleville (the Diocese), alleging that a priest within the Diocese, Raymond E Kownacki, sexually abused him numerous times between 1973 and 1978. Wisniewski asserted claims against the Diocese for negligence, wilful and wanton conduct, fraud and deceit, and civil conspiracy. Wisniewski alleged that the Diocese knew that Kownacki had molested other children at other parishes before transferring him to St. Theresa’s school and church in Salem, Illinois. On August 27, 2008, a jury awarded Wisniewski $2.4 million in compensatory damages and $2.6 million in punitive damages, and the circuit court entered a judgment upon the jury’s verdict. The Diocese timely filed a notice of appeal of the circuit court’s judgment. On appeal, the Diocese argues the following: (I) that Wisniewski’s claims were barred by the applicable statute of limitations and statute of repose, (II) that Wisniewski’s claims were insufficient as a matter of law, (III) that the circuit court abused its discretion in denying the Diocese’s motion for a mental examination of Wisniewski under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 215 (eff. July 1, 2002), and (IV) that the circuit court abused its discretion in striking certain references from the records and testimony of one of Wisniewski’s witnesses. The Diocese does not claim that the verdict is excessive. For the following reasons, we affirm.\nBACKGROUND\nThe Diocese is a religious not-for-profit corporation that ministers to more than 100,000 Catholics in the southernmost 28 counties of the State of Illinois. The Diocese includes approximately 116 parishes, 26 or 27 Catholic grade schools, and 3 high schools, and it employs approximately 140 priests. The Diocese has four officers: the bishop serves as the president or CEO of the not-for-profit corporation, the vicar general serves as the vice president, the chancellor serves as the secretary, and the chief financial officer serves as the treasurer. The vicar general is second in the Diocese’s chain of command and serves as the alter ego of the bishop in the administrative affairs of the Diocese. The chancellor of the Diocese is responsible for keeping the archives, records, and official Diocese files, including personnel files. The Diocese also employs a vice-chancellor, who works as an archivist and an ecclesiastical notary but is not an officer of the not-for-profit corporation. The Diocese employs a secretary for the bishop, whose duties include keeping track of the bishop’s appointments, typing letters for the bishop, serving as the bishop’s driver, and visiting the various parishes in the Diocese with the bishop. The bishop, the bishop’s secretary, the vicar general, the chancellor, and the vice-chancellor all work together in a building called the chancery, which is located in Belleville, Illinois.\nAt the trial, Wisniewski presented evidence that, when he was a young boy growing up in Salem, Illinois, he and his family were parishioners of St. Theresa’s parish located in Salem. Beginning in 1973, when he was 12 years old, Wisniewski endured repeated incidents of sexual molestation by a priest employed by the Diocese. The molestation occurred over a number of years. The priest was Raymond F. Kownacki, and at the trial, the Diocese did not deny that Kownacki committed the acts of sexual abuse described by Wisniewski. Wisniewski’s claim against the Diocese is based on the assertion that the Diocese was responsible for the molestation he endured because the Diocese knew that Kownacki had molested other children at other parishes before it transferred Kownacki to St. Theresa’s parish in Salem. An analysis of Wisniewski’s claim against the Diocese requires a consideration of events that occurred while Kownacki was in Salem and a consideration of events that occurred during the years before and after Kownacki came to Salem. We review the facts presented at the trial in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. Quality Granite Construction Co. v. Hurst-Rosche Engineers, Inc., 261 Ill. App. 3d 21, 24, 632 N.E.2d 1139, 1141 (1994).\nI.\nThe Diocese’s Knowledge of Kownacki’s History of Child Sexual Abuse\nKownacki was born December 8, 1934, and he was first ordained as a priest in the Catholic Church on June 4, 1960. Kownacki served the Catholic Church at various locations after he was ordained, including O’Fallon and East St. Louis, Illinois, and Guatemala. The record contains little information concerning the earliest years of Kownacki’s ministry. On December 9, 1970, the Diocese appointed Kownacki as the priest of a parish in the small town of St. Francisville, Illinois. At St. Francisville, Kownacki met a young girl at the parish named Gina Parks. On June 8, 1971, the Diocese transferred Kownacki to St. Martin of Tours parish in Washington Park, Illinois.\nSometime in 1973, the Diocese became aware of allegations that Kownacki had sexually abused Gina. At that time, the bishop of the Diocese was Albert R. Zuroweste and the Diocese’s chancellor was Monsignor Bernard Sullivan. Sullivan, the Diocese’s records keeper, had the habit of taking extensive notes of each of his telephone conversations and meetings. On April 24, 1973, Bishop Zuroweste, Chancellor Sullivan, and another priest, Dean Braun, met with Gina Parks and her family at the chancery to discuss abuse Kownacki perpetrated against Gina. As was his custom, Sullivan took extensive handwritten notes during that meeting, and he transcribed his handwritten notes three days later.\nThe first two paragraphs of Sullivan’s April 27, 1973, typed notes detailed allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct involving Kownacki that the Diocese had previously received notice of and that were in addition to the abuse reported by Gina and her parents on April 24, 1973. Sullivan’s notes began as follows:\n“Last year complaint from man in Guatemala that you [Kownacki] were sleeping with his daughter and she was pregnant by you. We accepted explanation that this man was jealous and was trying to make you the scape goat.\nLast month a priest came to us and said the parents of a 14 year old girl complained to him that you were molesting their daughter. We instructed the priest to have the parents go to you and complain, and if they could not obtain satisfaction then they should come to the Chancery.”\nSullivan’s typed notes then continued with a detailed description of Gina and her parents’ complaint of sexual abuse committed by Kownacki. The notes stated that Gina and her family came to the chancery on April 24, 1973, to inform the officers of the Diocese about Kownacki’s repeated molestation of and violence toward Gina, a minor.\nAccording to Sullivan’s notes, Gina, a 16-year-old girl, attended religious instruction classes taught by Kownacki in St. Francisville. In addition, Gina cleaned the rectory for Kownacki in St. Francisville. At the April 24, 1973, meeting, Gina described an occasion when Kownacki took her to his mother’s house in Tamaroa, Illinois, to clean. Sullivan’s notes of the meeting quoted Gina as follows: “ ‘Then that night we stayed in his Mother’s home, and I went to bed and the next thing I knew Father was in bed with me and we had intercourse.’ ” At the meeting, Gina also described another incident when Kownacki came into the bathroom as she cleaned, closed the door, and started kissing her.\nGina told the officers of the Diocese that Kownacki told her that he had money and could send her to school to study art. When Kownacki was assigned to the parish in Washington Park, Illinois, he convinced Gina’s parents to allow her to go to Washington Park with him. Kownacki told her parents that he would send Gina to school and would pay her $200 per month to be his housekeeper. Gina told the Diocese’s bishop and chancellor about incidents of physical and sexual abuse she endured at the hands of Kownacki after they moved to Washington Park. The abuse continued regularly for nearly two years. Kownacki gave her alcohol and assured her that the sexual abuse was a good thing because God wanted people to love each other. The last incident occurred in March of 1973. At Washington Park, Gina eventually started dating a classmate, Carlos, and Kownacki became jealous of that relationship. At one point, Kownacki slapped Gina, called her a whore and a slut, and told her she was wrong in sharing her body with Carlos.\nKownacki told Gina about his housekeeper in Guatemala with whom he had sexual relations, and he boasted about many other girls who came to him in Guatemala “just for the pleasure of sex.” Kownacki told Gina that his housekeeper in Guatemala became pregnant. He told Gina that he was not the father of the housekeeper’s child because he was sterile but that he came back to the United States to get away from her. At some point, Sullivan’s notes continue, Gina also became pregnant. Kownacki reported to Gina that his doctor had now told him that he was not sterile. Gina did not know if her child’s father was Kownacki or her boyfriend. Kownacki told Gina that if she did not want the baby, she could have an abortion. He gave Gina a drink on two different days for the purpose of aborting the baby. Kownacki also told Gina that if the drinks did not work, he could “squeeze it out.” Gina told the Diocese’s bishop and chancellor that Kownacki put his fingers inside her, against her will, and tried to abort the baby, which caused her pain and a cervical infection.\nAt the meeting, Gina also reported to the Diocese that a pair of twin boys from Guatemala lived with Kownacki while he was assigned to the parish in Washington Park. According to Sullivan’s notes, Gina reported that one of the twins engaged in “homosexuality” with Kownacki. Gina also reported the name of another 14-year-old girl at the St. Martin of Tours parish in Washington Park whom she believed Kownacki was also involved with. Sullivan’s notes identified the girl by name. His notes indicated that Kownacki told Gina that he went to confession every week or so and that the bishop knew what he was doing. At the conclusion of their meeting with Gina and her family, the bishop and the chancellor determined that they needed to speak with Kownacki.\nOn April 26, 1973, Kownacki wrote Gina a letter, in which he said, among other things, “[D]espite scandal, reputation to me as a priest, *** I will always see that you are through this little crisis.” He told her that he was really concerned and cared about her and always would. He hoped that she was feeling much better and that she was happy. He told her that she had been the best part of his life in Washington Park and in St. Francisville. The next day, April 27, 1973, the bishop and the chancellor met with Kownacki at the chancery to discuss Gina’s allegations. At the end of his typewritten notes, Sullivan made a note of their meeting with Kownacki and further wrote as follows: “We told him the whole story without the details. We said he needs help.”\nAfter his meeting at the chancery, Kownacki wrote a second letter to Gina. In a letter dated May 2, 1973, he wrote to Gina as follows: “Guess it’s time to say ‘adios’ to a great little girl who will always be remembered as the best girl I knew and hoping I’m cured of my problem[;] you’ll always be in my mind.” He wrote that it took “shock from all sides” to make him realize that he needed help. He wrote that he would suffer “like Cain” in the future when people point a finger at him and say that he is an alcoholic and “a real mental case.” He told Gina, “[The] parishioners know only that I’m going away for a rest because of a possible nervous breakdown (which is literally true, too!).” He wrote, “Blot out from your memory the past two years and if you cannot, then all I ask is. . . . forgive me!” He told Gina that she could get his address but that he presumed she still thought of him as “that monster” who ruined her future.\nAt some point, the Diocese obtained copies of Kownacki’s letters to Gina. The record does not indicate how or when the Diocese obtained copies of the letters, but the record discloses that it had copies of Kownacki’s letters as early as 1984. The Diocese’s copies of Kownacki’s letters to Gina were placed in his personnel file, but Sullivan’s handwritten and transcribed notes were not. Instead, the Diocese kept Sullivan’s notes in a separate location that was undisclosed in the record.\nPrior to the 1990s, the Diocese did not have any specific policies or rules with respect to handling allegations of child sexual abuse by priests. The Catholic Church’s code of canon law, however, set out certain standards and rules that the Diocese was required to follow. The code of canon law required the bishop, or someone he delegated, to investigate allegations of sexual abuse or misconduct that were brought against any priest within the Diocese, and if the investigation showed the probability that something had happened, then a judicial trial was to be held. The Diocese, however, did not conduct any trial with respect to Gina’s allegations of abuse.\nInstead, approximately 1½ months after Gina reported Kownacki to the Diocese, Bishop Zuroweste asked Kownacki to resign as the pastor of St. Martin of Tours. Kownacki subsequently resigned from the parish effective June 28, 1973. The Diocese did not investigate the allegations of sexual misconduct by Kownacki while he was in Guatemala or the allegations of sexual misconduct involving the twin boys from Guatemala or the 14-year-old girl at St. Martin of Tours whom Gina had identified by name. In addition, the Diocese never disclosed the allegations of sexual abuse to any authorities or to any of the parishioners of St. Martin of Tours in Washington Park or the parishioners in St. Francisville. No one from the Diocese reached out to Gina to offer her any assistance in dealing with Kownacki’s abuse. Less than four months after removing Kownacki from the parish in Washington Park, the Diocese appointed Kownacki to St. Theresa’s parish in Salem, Illinois.\nII.\nWisniewski’s Childhood Before and After Meeting Kownacki\nWisniewski was born in 1961 in Wisconsin, and he was the second youngest child in a family of five children. At the time of the trial, he was 47 years old. Both of Wisniewski’s parents, Mel and Marcy, were raised in devout Catholic families in Wisconsin. Mel and Marcy attended Catholic grade schools and high schools in Wisconsin, went to church every week, and raised their children in the same Catholic traditions and environment. They took their children to church every Sunday, and they raised Wisniewski and his siblings to respect the priests of the church, to believe that they spoke God’s word, and to be actively involved in church life. Mel testified that Catholic priests, monsignors, and bishops were put on a pedestal in his family. Mel raised his family to do whatever the agents of the church said and to never question them.\nMel and Marcy moved their family from Wisconsin to rural Salem, Illinois, in 1964, when Wisniewski was three years old. They moved to Salem so Mel could open a retail music store. The only Catholic church in Salem, Illinois, was St. Theresa’s Catholic Church. Before moving their family to Salem, Mel and Marcy visited the church to meet the priest who was serving the church at that time. They joined St. Theresa’s before moving their family to Salem, and they have been members of that church ever since.\nAfter moving to Salem, Wisniewski and his brother and sisters became active in Catholic church life at St. Theresa’s parish. They attended the Catholic grade school in Salem before it closed, they received religious instructions and training at the church, and the bishop of the Diocese confirmed them into the faith. They attended mass every Sunday and sometimes during the week. Wisniewski’s father served as a commentator during mass at times. Wisniewski testified that he grew up to love the church and its teachings and to believe in the church. From a very young age, he was taught to respect the priests, to believe what they said was true, and to obey them.\nWisniewski and his parents described Salem in the 1970s as a small, friendly community, where everyone knew one another. The parents in Salem looked out for one another’s children, and the children rode their bicycles around the town without any concern from the parents. As a boy, Wisniewski was quiet and obedient. He did what he was told to do and never got into trouble. In 1973, he turned 12 years old and enjoyed a healthy and happy childhood. The course of Wisniewski’s life, however, was forever altered on November 8, 1973, when the Diocese appointed Raymond F. Kownacki as the priest at St. Theresa’s in Salem.\nOn October 26, 1973, the bishop sent a letter to Kownacki informing him of his appointment as the pastor of St. Theresa’s parish in Salem, Illinois, effective November 8, 1973. Speaking on behalf of the Diocese, the bishop told Kownacki that they were confident that he would find the people of the parish “responsive to [Kownacki’s] pastoral zeal.” In addition, the bishop expressed appreciation to Kownacki for his “help in solving the problems in Guatemala.”\nThe Diocese prepared an official appointment of Kownacki as the parish priest that was addressed to Kownacki. The official appointment sent to Kownacki, or a similar document addressed to the parish, would have been read to the parishioners of St. Theresa’s parish. The bishop’s official appointment stated that he had confidence in Kownacki’s knowledge, piety, prudence, experience, and general character. The Diocese’s official appointment “commanded] all, whom it may concern, to recognize [Kownacki] as such Pastor and grant [him] all necessary assistance.” No one from the Diocese informed the parishioners of St. Theresa’s about Kownacki’s past violence, sexual abuse, or sexual misconduct. At the trial, the Diocese’s official corporate representative, Monsignor James Margason, testified that by appointing Kownacki as the parish priest, the Diocese held Kownacki out as being safe and suitable to minister to the parishioners and have unsupervised contact with the parishioners’ children. No one from the Diocese restricted or supervised Kownacki’s contact with the minor children of St. Theresa’s. Since Mel and Marcy had no reason to distrust Kownacki, they put their full faith and trust in him to minister to their children.\nShortly after he came to St. Theresa’s, Kownacki met Wisniewski and began giving him special attention. Wisniewski took over the duties of taking care of the grounds around the church and around the priest’s residence, the rectory. With Marcy’s encouragement, Wisniewski also became an altar boy shortly after Kownacki arrived. Wisniewski started spending more time around the church than with his friends, and Mel and Marcy thought that was good because Wisniewski was helping the church. Mel’s retail music business required him to work long hours; so he and Marcy were pleased that their trusted priest had developed a special interest in their youngest son. Neither Mel nor Marcy had any reservations about Wisniewski working for Kownacki, because he was a priest.\nAt the trial, Wisniewski testified that he initially considered Kownacki a friend and someone to look up to. Kownacki related well to the children of the parish and was fun to be around. Wisniewski was interested in photography, and Kownacki purchased cameras and set up a darkroom in the church basement. Kownacki encouraged Wisniewski to take pictures around the parish community and at parish activities to be included in a parish newsletter and bulletin that Kownacki had planned. Wisniewski became interested in and talked to Kownacki about the priesthood and the functions of a priest. With the Diocese’s endorsement, Kownacki had the complete trust and confidence of St. Theresa’s parishioners, including Wisniewski and his parents.\nA few months after getting to know Wisniewsk, Kownacki asked him and another boy to spend the night with him at the rectory. That night, Wisniewski and the other boy watched movies with Kownacki. Kownacki plied them with alcohol. Wisniewski testified that it was hard alcohol of some type and that he had never had alcohol prior to that evening. As the evening progressed, the other boy became sleepy, and he retired to a spare bedroom in the rectory. Unfortunately, Wisniewski stayed awake watching television with Kownacki. Kownacki moved over to Wisniewski and started rubbing the 12-year-old’s shoulders and kissing his neck. Kownacki’s hand moved down and rubbed Wisniewski’s genitalia. Wisniewski had not been previously exposed to any kind of sexual encounter or education, and he was taught to obey and trust priests. He was confused. Kownacki led Wisniewski into his bedroom, took off Wisniewski’s clothes, and took off his own clothes. Kownacki performed oral sex on Wisniewski while he masturbated himself. After the molestation, Kownacki fell asleep. Wisniewski got up, washed himself, and went back into the other room. Wisniewski did not say anything to his parents or anyone else the next day because he was afraid he would get in trouble.\nWisniewski testified that additional incidents of sexual abuse continued after that evening on a continual basis for several years. The next incident of abuse occurred shortly after the first one, and the sexual abuse became “very routine.” The abuse consisted of mainly oral sex that occurred in the rectory, in the school, in the church, and in the darkroom that Kownacki had built for Wisniewski. Kownacki eventually told the other boys who also worked around the church that they were no longer needed, so that he could be alone with Wisniewski. Kownacki took Wisniewski on trips to St. Louis, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Guatemala, and Rome. Wisniewski testified that Kownacki sexually molested him on some overnight trips.\nAt the trial, Wisniewski did not remember the exact number of times he was molested by Kownacki, but he remembered it being more than 50 times. At first the abuse occurred on a weekly basis, but as the years went by and as Wisniewski became an older adolescent, the abuse tapered off and eventually ended by the time he was a sophomore or junior in high school.\nA psychiatrist, Dr. Stephen Peterson, testified that Kownacki utilized two coercive tactics to keep Wisniewski silent about and submissive to the abuse: positive coercion and negative coercion. At first, Kownacki used positive coercion by giving Wisniewski special attention in order to set him up for easy manipulation. In addition, Kownacki’s positive coercive tactics included telling Wisniewski that the sexual molestation was okay, that the Church condoned that sort of thing, and that there were other priests in the Diocese who did the same thing. Kownacki also used positive coercion by telling Wisniewski that the abuse was his way of relieving his stress. He also told Wisniewski that it proved that he was growing up and that it was good for him. Wisniewski testified that since he was taught to obey and believe the priest, he trusted Kownacki. He believed that what he was doing was okay because of what Kownacki told him. Peterson testified that Kownacki overwhelmed Wisniewski and programmed him to accept the behavior as good.\nHowever, there were times during the abuse that Wisniewski felt guilty about what was happening to him, and Kownacki could sense Wisniewski’s reluctance at these times. Kownacki then utilized what Peterson described as negative coercive tactics. At times when Wisniewski resisted Kownacki’s molestation, Kownacki threatened to tell everyone that Wisniewski was gay, to ruin Wisniewski’s parents’ business, and to force his family to move out of town. Kownacki kept a box next to his bed that contained a handgun, and there were times when Kownacki made threats to use the gun if Wisniewski ever told anyone about what was happening between them. One time Kownacki threatened to kill Wisniewski’s parents, and another time he threatened to kill himself. Kownacki’s threats scared Wisniewski, and he took them seriously. In addition, Wisniewski did not want his friends or anyone else to know what was happening, and he was afraid of people finding out if he said anything. Wisniewski testified that many times Kownacki was drunk when he made the threats and that Kownacki was mean when he was drunk.\nWisniewski testified that he continued to work around the parish grounds and agreed to go on trips with Kownacki because Kownacki had befriended him and, at the same time, he was afraid of Kownacki’s threats. He did not know what Kownacki was capable of, and in addition, he was still trusting, believing, and putting his faith in the Catholic priest.\nMel and Marcy had completely trusted Kownacki with their son and had no reservations about Wisniewski being around him. They testified that, had the Diocese told them that Kownacki had sexually molested other children in the past, they would not have allowed Wisniewski or any of their other children to be around him. However, no one from the Diocese told them anything about Kownacki’s past. Instead, the bishop publicly gave Kownacki his full confidence, vouched for his suitability to serve as the parish priest, and held him out as suitable to minister to and have unsupervised contact with the parish children.\nWisniewski graduated from high school in 1980, moved to Champaign, Illinois, and enrolled in Parkland College. At that point, Wisniewski wanted to move on with his life, and he successfully mastered the ability to put Kownacki’s molestation out of his mind. Although he never totally forgot about the abuse, he became successful in blocking it out of his mind. He did not let the abuse impact his daily activities or his psychological health. Wisniewski felt comfort in believing that he was Kownacki’s only victim. Kownacki had told him that he was the only one, and Wisniewski believed what Kownacki said. In addition, Wisniewski had no reason to believe that the Diocese had any knowledge relevant to Kownacki’s dangerous propensities. For a few years after Wisniewski moved away from Salem, Kownacki continued to serve as the priest at St. Theresa’s. Kownacki performed the marriages of Wisniewski’s brother and two of his sisters. Kownacki visited Wisniewski on a few occasions in Champaign, and he agreed to visit with Kownacki because he was afraid of the ramifications of telling him no.\nIII.\nAdditional Acts of Child Sexual Abuse and the Diocese’s Silence and Concealment\nMeanwhile, Kownacki’s sexual molestation and misconduct continued within the Diocese after Wisniewski left Salem, and the officers of the Diocese were aware of his continuing misconduct and abuse. In 1982, someone within the Diocese prepared a confidential report that detailed new allegations of sexual molestation by Kownacki. The report was not signed, and the evidence presented at the trial did not establish who authored the report. The evidence did establish, however, that the report was prepared by someone within the Diocese. The Diocese did not keep the report in Kownacki’s personnel file but kept it in an undisclosed location in the chancery.\nThe 1982 report described information that the Diocese had received from the parents of a high school freshman boy at St. Theresa’s parish in Salem. The parents reported an incident involving Kownacki and their son. The freshman boy had been mowing Kownacki’s grass, and Kownacki called him on a Saturday and asked him to stay overnight. The freshman boy went jogging or had a track meet, and when he returned to the rectory, Kownacki told him to take a shower and that he would give him a massage. The report stated as follows: “This is when everything happened: fondling, kissing etc. [The boy] wanted to go home but [Kownacki] made him stay all night.”\nThe Diocese’s report also stated that Kownacki told the boy about two other parish boys whom he had also been involved with at one time. The report stated, “One is Jim Wisniewski (spelling?).” The boy did not remember the other victim’s name. According to the report, Kownacki told the freshman about the other boys because the boy was upset by what Kownacki was trying to do to him. Kownacki told him, “This is okay; I’ve done it before.” He told him that it was “a sign of friendship” and made him promise not to tell his parents.\nThe 1982 report stated that the mother of the freshman boy also reported to the Diocese that there was “an element of fear in her family” because she and her husband were concerned that Kownacki “might become vicious” after he found out she had reported him. They were keeping their doors locked and were careful where their children went. The unknown author of the 1982 confidential Diocese report concluded that Kownacki was “sick.” The Diocese representative who prepared the report assured the parents that something would be done. The report indicates that the parents responded that if something was not done, they would file a lawsuit because they did not want the same thing to happen to any other parish boys.\nIn 1982, Joseph Schwaegel served as the secretary to the bishop as well as the vice-chancellor of the Diocese. Schwaegel testified that, after the parents of the freshman boy complained to the Diocese that Kownacki had sexually molested their son, he had at least one conversation with the parents and asked them to keep quiet about what had happened. Schwaegel testified that the Diocese did not want to “go hanging the dirty laundry all over the line.” Therefore, he told the parents not to let “this get out all over the parish.” He told them, “Let’s just keep it quiet and try to get this resolved in whatever manner the Diocese will decide how to resolve this.”\nSchwaegel testified that, because of what the parents reported, he became aware that Wisniewski might have been a victim of sexual abuse committed by Kownacki. However, he did not make any attempt to contact Wisniewski or his parents. In addition, no one else from the Diocese contacted Wisniewski or his parents upon learning that Wisniewski had been molested by Kownacki. At the trial, Schwaegel was asked: “This boy [Wisniewski] was forgotten. He was written off as dirty laundry, wasn’t he?” Schwaegel answered, “Yes.”\nAlthough he was aware of the 1982 confidential memo at the time it was prepared, at the trial, Schwaegel denied ever seeing Sullivan’s 1973 notes that detailed Kownacki’s child sexual abuse of Gina. He testified that he was not working at the chancery when Sullivan created those notes and that there had been no need for Sullivan to share that information with him after he arrived at the chancery in late June of 1973.\nAfter the parents reported Kownacki’s abuse of their freshman son, the Diocese removed Kownacki as the parish priest at St. Theresa’s in Salem and immediately reassigned him as the pastor of St. Joseph’s parish in Cobden, Illinois, effective July 6, 1982. At this time, the bishop of the Diocese was John N. Wurm. On June 8, 1982, Bishop Wurm sent Kownacki a letter informing him that his new appointment was in view of his “dedicated priestly services” to the local church of Belleville. The bishop stated in his letter, “I heartily commend you to all the people of your parish.” When he was transferred to Cobden, Kownacki did not receive a pay cut, a demotion, a demerit, or any mark on his record.\nWhen the Diocese removed Kownacki as the parish priest at St. Theresa’s, it did not inform the parishioners that it had removed him because of allegations of sexual abuse. Although Bishop Wurm and other officers at the chancery were aware of the contents of the confidential 1982 report, the Diocese did not inform anyone at the parishes in Salem or in Cobden about the allegations brought by the mother of the freshman boy or about the allegation that Kownacki had molested Wisniewski and another boy at the parish. In addition, the Diocese did not tell any parishioners about prior allegations that Kownacki had committed sexual abuse and misconduct in Guatemala, with the twin boys he brought back from Guatemala, with Gina Parks, or with the 14-year-old girl at St. Martin of Tours. Instead, the Diocese held Kownacki out as an appropriate priest to minister to the parishioners in Cobden and to have unsupervised contact with the parishioners’ minor children. Schwaegel testified that when Kownacki was transferred to Cobden, everyone at the chancery knew that Kownacki was sick and liked to molest children. However, the Diocese did not provide any special supervision over Kownacki after he was transferred to Cobden.\nOn June 21, 1982, the local newspaper in Salem printed an article about Kownacki’s transfer to Cobden. The article reported that Kownacki was leaving St. Theresa’s parish because he had asked the bishop for an assignment in Cobden to “work with the Hispanic community in the Cobden area.” Kownacki was quoted in the article as follows: “ T find this assignment just another deep challenge of ministry ***. *** I have always loved the Spanish culture and even though I consider myself a “liberal-conservative,” I think I can be of help to the People of God of the Cobden area. Otherwise I would not have asked for a change in ministry.’ ”\nThe parents of the freshman boy at St. Theresa’s who had reported Kownacki to the Diocese were not happy with the contents of the newspaper article, and they wrote a letter addressed to Vice-Chancellor Schwaegel to express their displeasure. The parents stated in their letter that it had been a difficult time for their family and that they knew that the way that the bishop handled “the situation” was best for the parish and the “Catholic church as a whole.” However, the parents included a copy of the article with their letter and stated, “Here is a man, a priest who committed a very serious sin and instead of being sorry and leaving quietly, he pads it by lying.” The letter stated that the family had done as they were asked and had not “said anything to anybody.”\nSchwaegel responded to the parents in a letter dated June 25, 1982. Schwaegel told the family in his letter that he could understand their “difficulty in accepting the manner in which [Kownacki] describe[d] his termination at Salem and new assignment in Cobden.” Schwaegel continued, “Since you have been so kind in the manner in which you handled this situation, I am giving [Kownacki] the benefit of the doubt and praying that he truly desires to make a fresh start.” After telling the family that it was difficult to let “bygones be bygones,” he stated that he was sorry that Kownacki had to learn his lesson at the expense of their family.\nAt the trial, Schwaegel admitted that he gave Kownacki the benefit of the doubt without ever interviewing him. He testified that he relied on others inside the chancery for advice and that it was not his decision alone. In addition, he admitted that Kownacki had not learned any lesson as his letter falsely stated. Instead, the Diocese simply reassigned him to another parish, did not discipline him, and did not even give him a written warning.\nFor reasons undisclosed in the record, Kownacki was a priest in Cobden for less than a year before the Diocese transferred him to St. Mary’s parish in Harrisburg, Illinois. In a letter dated June 13, 1983, Bishop Wurm notified Kownacki that, in view of his “dedicated priestly service,” he had been appointed the pastor of St. Mary’s parish in Harrisburg and that he heartily commended him to all the people of that parish. Again, the Diocese did not inform the parishioners in Harrisburg about the previous allegations that Kownacki had sexually molested children and engaged in sexual misconduct.\nOn August 9, 1984, Schwaegel received a telephone call from another priest of the Diocese, Don Abell, who reported problems that the Harrisburg parish was having with Kownacki. Abell reported to Schwaegel that the trustees of the Harrisburg parish were irate over some recent incidents. Kownacki had two boys living in the rectory, and one of them had walked through a plate glass door. Abell told Schwaegel that a doctor had “fixed the kid up” and no one would “say how it happened.” Abell reported that Kownacki was paying the two boys $150 per week but that they did “absolutely nothing.” According to Abell, the janitor at the church also reported that many times when he arrived at the rectory in the morning, as many as five or six boys left the rectory, and the janitor presumed that they had been there all night. Abell told Schwaegel that Kownacki had “to be removed immediately or there [would] be nothing left of the Harrisburg parish.”\nBishop Wurm passed away in April of 1984, and the Diocese was between bishops at the time Abell made the telephone call to Schwaegel. Therefore, Schwaegel drafted a memo to Monsignor James Margason, passing on Abell’s information. Margason had been serving as the Diocese’s vicar general since October of 1983, and when Bishop Wurm passed away, he was appointed as the administrator of the Diocese until the appointment of a new bishop. In addition, in the 1970s, Margason had obtained a law degree in Rome on the Catholic Church’s code of canon law. Schwaegel’s memo to Margason concluded with, “good luck, Joe.” Schwaegel testified that in signing, “good luck,” he meant, “here we go again with Kownacki, so good luck with this one.”\nBecause Schwaegel’s memo stated that young boys were living in the rectory, one of Margason’s concerns was the possibility of improper sexual activity between Kownacki and the boys. Margason began his investigation by speaking with Chancellor Sullivan at the chancery and asking him if he had any information about allegations of sexual abuse or misconduct involving Kownacki that were not included in Kownacki’s personnel file. Sullivan then gave Margason copies of his notes from the meeting with Gina and her family that had occurred back on April 24, 1973. Margason testified that he had not seen Sullivan’s notes prior to investigating Kownacki in Harrisburg.\nMargason went to Harrisburg and met with the trustees of the Harrisburg parish. During the meeting, the trustees raised their concerns with Kownacki, including that young boys were living in the rectory, that the boys seemed to do nothing but were being paid, that Kownacki was drinking heavily, and that he had purchased a car in the parish’s name. The trustees were concerned because the parish was located in an area that was primarily non-Catholic, and they were concerned that their reputations were being damaged by Kownacki’s activities.\nMargason also talked to the church’s janitor, to Kownacki, and to the two boys who were living in the rectory with Kownacki. He testified that the boys could have been minors, but he was not sure. The two boys admitted that they had been staying at the rectory and had been drinking with Kownacki. They denied any sexual activity. One of the boys stated that he had an interest in becoming a priest. Kownacki and the boys denied that any other boys stayed at the rectory. At the trial, Margason testified that since Kownacki and the boys denied any sexual activity, he had to take their word. However, he did not try to contact the boys’ parents.\nMargason testified that having two boys living in the rectory was inappropriate and against the Diocesan statutes. Therefore, Margason told Kownacki and the boys that they all had to leave immediately. He offered Kownacki medical help; Kownacki accepted and returned to Belleville. Margason testified that Kownacki was removed from the Harrisburg parish because he was drinking, was misusing parish funds, and had people staying in the rectory who should not have been there.\nMargason stayed at the parish in Harrisburg that weekend and performed the parish services, a funeral, and a wake service. When Margason spoke with the Harrisburg parishioners, he told them that Kownacki had some problems and that he hoped the Diocese could get him the help he needed. Margason did not specifically tell the parishioners what kinds of problem Kownacki had or what kind of help he needed. He told the parishioners that it was time for a new beginning and that what had happened in the past was the past. Margason knew that there were stories circulating about Kownacki in the community. He told the parishioners that there was no point in saying “this is what I heard happened” or in repeating stories. Margason emphasized to the parishioners that if there was the slightest doubt in their minds that something they heard was true, then in justice they should not repeat it.\nOn September 10, 1984, Sullivan sent Kownacki a form for him to sign as his resignation as the pastor of St. Mary’s church in Harrisburg, effective August 17, 1984. The document stated that the resignation was due to an illness which prevented him from satisfactorily performing his pastoral duties. Kownacki was placed on sick leave and was assigned to the Hincke House as his residence and for treatment. At that time, he was not assigned to another parish.\nOn December 11, 1984, James E Keleher was ordained as the Diocese’s bishop, and Margason continued to serve as the vicar general under Bishop Keleher. In the late 1970s, the Diocese had established a personnel board that advised the bishop concerning appointments of priests to various parishes and offices in the Diocese. The personnel board members included the bishop, the vicar general, the chancellor, the vice-chancellor, and the secretary to the bishop. After the Diocese removed Kownacki from the Harrisburg parish and admitted him into the Hincke House for treatment, he became the subject of conversation at subsequent meetings of the personnel board. At the time, the personnel board included Bishop Keleher, Margason, Schwaegel, and Sullivan, among others. Schwaegel also served as the secretary of the personnel board, taking notes and preparing minutes.\nThe personnel review board met on February 26, 1985, and the minutes of that meeting stated that Margason was to visit Kownacki the following day. Nothing in the record reflects the Diocese doing anything further with respect to Kownacki until the April 2, 1985, personnel meeting. The minutes of that meeting stated, “In making assignments, must not forget about Fr. Kownacki.” The minutes of the May 9, 1985, meeting of the personnel board stated: “Fr. Kownacki is ready for a parish. Bishop informed him the Board is about ready to come up with a parish.”\nOn May 15, 1985, Bishop Keleher sent Kownacki a letter informing him that he was appointed the pastor of St. Eatrick’s parish in Tipton, Illinois, and the Immaculate Conception parish in Madonnaville, Illinois. The bishop’s letter stated that he was looking forward to Kownacki’s graduation from St. Michael’s on May 29, 1985, and that he was very pleased with the progress Kownacki made during his time at St. Michael’s. Testimony at the trial established that St. Michael’s is an alcohol treatment facility for priests.\nThe bishop told Kownacki in his letter: “[A]s you assume the pastoral responsibility of the parish communities at Tipton and Madonnaville, I am confident you will carry out your mission well in building up the Body of Christ at these two beautiful parishes. I will be also grateful for your strong support of Gibault High School.” The bishop concluded his letter with a profession of support for Kownacki in his new position. The letter stated that the appointment was after consultation with and approval by the personnel board. In a letter dated June 25, 1985, the bishop informed Kownacki that he was also appointed the pastor of St. Mary’s in Valmeyer, Illinois, after consultation with and approval of the personnel board. The bishop was confident that Kownacki would carry out his “mission well in building up the Body of Christ in these three beautiful parishes.”\nAgain, the Diocese did not inform Kownaeki’s new parishioners of the past allegations of sexual abuse or misconduct. By appointing Kownacki to these parishes, the Diocese again held him out as a safe and suitable priest to minister to the parishioners and have unsupervised contact with their children. This appointment included attending mass and performing services at Gibault Catholic High School.\nShortly after his new assignment, new allegations of impropriety arose involving Kownacki and young boys. In 1986, the rectory housekeeper at the Valmeyer parish met with Margason to talk about Kownacki and also sent Margason two letters about Kownacki. The housekeeper reported to Margason that there were young boys living in the rectory and that she had found a note in the rectory that was addressed to one of the boys. The note stated as follows: “Dear [redacted name of boy], come up to my bedroom if I am sleeping or not and massage me. I need it. I love you [redacted name of boy]. Ray.” The housekeeper also told Margason that she had also found a Playboy magazine in the rectory and found a “sexy picture out of a magazine under his bed.” She asked Margason to figure out what was “going on over there with those boys” and stated that “more and more people are going to Waterloo to mass because of [Kownacki] and what they hear.” The housekeeper stated that there was “something the matter” with Kownacki and that something had to be done before he wrecked the whole parish.\nMargason testified that the note that the housekeeper described was inappropriate for a priest to write to a young boy. Very soon after receiving this information, Margason went to Valmeyer to talk with the housekeeper, Kownacki, and the two young boys. Kownacki told Margason that there had not been any inappropriate activity with the boys but that he did not deny that the two young boys were spending time with him at the rectory. Margason did not know whether the boys were minors, and no one from the Diocese contacted their parents.\nIn March of 1987, Kownacki was no longer the priest in Tipton, but he was still the priest at Valmeyer and Madonnaville. The person nel board met on March 18, 1987, and the meeting was attended by, among others, Bishop Keleher, Abell, Margason, Sullivan, and Schwaegel. The minutes of this meeting state as follows: “This led to much discussion on Fr. Kownacki. Bishop said while we must take care of a brother priest, the diocese must also be considered. Much discussion.” On April 7, 1987, the personnel board met again, and the minutes stated that “nothing much ha[d] changed” with respect to Kownacki and that the board “agreed he should be moved from Valmeyer now.” (Emphasis in original.) The board discussed placement options and concluded that placing Kownacki in a hospital chaplaincy ministry could be dangerous. They determined that he should be moved to the Hincke House again, but one member of the board, Father Eichenseer, was concerned that Kownacki would have a lot of free time to go wherever he wanted and questioned how he would be supervised and who would do the supervising. Sullivan stressed that Kownacki must be active and not just sit around.\nThe record indicates that the Diocese subsequently removed Kownacki from his parishes and assigned him to Poor Clares, which is a cloistered convent for nuns and where there were no children. Margason testified that the Diocese removed Kownacki from his parishes because he was drinking again and having people living in the rectory who did not belong there. The Diocese again did not provide Kownacki’s parishioners with any information concerning the reasons for his reassignment.\nIn a letter dated June 22, 1988, Bishop Keleher informed Kownacki that he had been appointed to residence at St. Henry’s parish in Belleville, “after consultation and approval of the Priest Personnel Board.” Testimony at the trial established that St. Henry’s parish is next door to St. Henry’s Catholic Grade School and is near Althoff Catholic High School in Belleville. However, the Diocese did not provide the parishioners of St. Henry’s with any information concerning the past allegations of child sexual abuse and held Kownacki out as being a safe and suitable priest to minister to the parishioners and have unsupervised contact with their children.\nAs noted above, prior to the 1990s, the Catholic Church’s code of canon law required the bishop, or someone whom he delegated, to investigate allegations of sexual abuse of minors by priests, and if the investigation showed the probability that something had happened, then a judicial trial was to be held. The Diocese did not conduct any such trials during the ’60s, ’70s, or ’80s. In addition, Margason testified that, to his knowledge, during this period of time, the Diocese did not disclose to the public or to its parishioners any of the allegations it was aware of concerning their priests molesting or abusing minors.\nIn 1993, the Diocese adopted a “Policy Regarding Clerical Sexual Misconduct with Minors.” The policy began as follows: “Sexual misconduct by a priest with a minor violates human dignity, priestly commitment and the mission of the church.” Article 4 of the policy required all persons associated with the Diocese to comply with the letter and spirit of the policy, which required full and complete disclosure of allegations of clerical sexual abuse or misconduct with minors. The new policy established a review board charged with the duty of investigating allegations of sexual abuse or misconduct involving minors that were brought against parish priests. The review board investigated allegations that were either reported directly to members of the clergy or reported through a hotline the Diocese established for reporting such allegations. The review board investigated both current and past allegations of child sexual abuse.\nThe review board was composed of at least seven members appointed by the bishop. Four members were lay Catholics who were not employees of the Diocese, and three members were priests. Margie Mensen served as the administrator for the review board, and she held that position until 1998. She testified that her responsibility as the administrator for the review board was to investigate the allegations of child sexual abuse to determine whether the allegations were credible and to report her findings to the review board. She also reported directly to the bishop and Margason. Mensen’s duties included communicating with the victims of the child sexual abuse, offering them counseling, and communicating with the accused priests. Mensen did not have her own access to the priests’ personnel files, but she had the right to ask to see them.\nIn September of 1993, Bishop Keleher was transferred to Kansas City, and Margason was again elected as the administrator of the Diocese until the appointment of a new bishop. Margason had helped draft the 1993 policy that established the review board, but after the review board was installed, he remained silent about his knowledge of past allegations of sexual abuse of minors by Kownacki. Margason served as the Diocese’s administrator until Wilton D. Gregory was installed as the bishop in February of 1994.\nApproximately seven months after his arrival at the Diocese, Bishop Gregory issued a press release which stated that he was going to personally review all the priests’ personnel files to determine whether there was any information in the files that indicated prior undisclosed allegations of sexual abuse, molestation, or misconduct involving a priest and a minor. Bishop Gregory publicly announced that he wanted to ensure that there were no allegations of abuse that were undisclosed to the review board.\nDuring his review of the priests’ personnel files, Gregory reviewed Kownacki’s file and felt that it should be brought to the attention of the review board. Gregory asked Mensen to review Kownacki’s file, investigate, and take her findings before the review board. In October of 1994, Mensen reviewed Kownacki’s personnel file at the chancery. The personnel file that Mensen reviewed, however, did not contain Sullivan’s notes of the interview of Gina in 1973 and did not contain the 1982 confidential memo that named Wisniewski as a victim of Kownacki’s abuse.\nKownacki’s personnel file did include copies of the letters he wrote to Gina on April 26, 1973, and on May 2, 1973. Mensen found the letters to be troubling because they seemed “very inappropriate for someone in the priest’s position or someone of his adult age to be writing in such a personal manner to a young girl.” To Mensen, the letters suggested undue and troubling closeness. Based on the letters, Mensen felt that there was cause to conclude that perhaps Gina had been a victim of childhood sexual abuse committed by Kownacki.\nIn addition to Kownacki’s letters to Gina, Kownacki’s file also included the June 21, 1982, letter from the mother of the freshman boy in Salem, Illinois, who complained to Schwaegel when Kownacki misrepresented the reason for his reassignment from St. Theresa’s in Salem to the parish in Cobden. The file also included Schwaegel’s June 25, 1982, response letter to the freshman boy’s parents. These two letters caused Mensen to be concerned that there had been some sexual abuse or molestation by Kownacki at St. Theresa’s. Mensen had no means to contact the two victims she identified in the file materials, so she contacted the victims’ parents. Mensen subsequently interviewed Gina and her parents.\nBoth Gina and her parents told Mensen how Kownacki had befriended their family and had offered various forms of assistance. They told Mensen how Kownacki repeatedly and violently sexually molested Gina, that Gina became pregnant and thought Kownacki might have been the father, and that Kownacki drugged her and personally performed an abortion on her in the rectory which resulted in her unborn child dying in útero. Gina and her family described the emotional toll and pain Kownacki had caused, and Gina expressed concern about other children Kownacki might have had contact with. Gina told Mensen that no one from the Diocese offered her any help or assistance. Mensen testified that she found Gina very credible and that her symptoms were “very consistent with victims of sexual abuse.”\nAfter following up with the family in Salem, Illinois, Mensen concluded that Kownacki should be removed from active ministry. She reported her conclusions to the review board, and the review board agreed that Kownacki was a risk to abuse or molest other children. The review board asked few questions, and its vote was unanimous. The Diocese removed Kownacki from active ministry on January 13, 1995. It placed him on administrative leave. Kownacki was not defrocked or punished. He collected retirement benefits from the Diocese, and at the time of the trial, he had suffered a stroke but was living by himself in an apartment in Dupo, Illinois.\nMargason admitted at the trial that Kownacki was finally removed from active ministry 21 years after the Diocese first knew that Kownacki was a violent sexual child molester and 10 years after Margason himself became aware that Kownacki was a violent sexual child molester. The review board removed Kownacki based, in large part, on information that the Diocese had been aware of since the 1970s. Margason testified that had there been an independent review board in place in 1973, there was a good likelihood that Kownacki would have been removed then and would not have met Wisniewski.\nBishop Gregory held a press conference concerning Kownacki shortly after his removal, and an article about his removal appeared in the Diocese’s newsletter, The Messenger, on January 20, 1995. The article stated that Kownacki was placed on administrative leave for allegations of sexual abuse that occurred more than 10 years prior.\nAlthough Kownacki was removed from active ministry, the Diocese never disclosed to Mensen or the review board the existence of Sullivan’s 1973 notes. As noted above, Sullivan’s 1973 notes referenced other incidents of sexual abuse and molestation in addition to the incidents involving Gina. Sullivan’s 1973 notes mentioned by name the twin boys from Guatemala who lived with Kownacki in Washington Park and another 14-year-old girl who was a parishioner in Washington Park as potential victims of Kownacki’s sexual molestation. The notes also identified by name the housekeeper in Guatemala whom Kownacki might have impregnated. Mensen testified that had she seen Sullivan’s notes, she would have investigated these additional incidents and would have attempted to reach these potential victims.\nFurthermore, the Diocese never disclosed to Mensen or the review board the 1982 confidential report that described the allegations from the family in Salem concerning their freshman son. As noted above, the 1982 report stated that Kownacki had claimed to have molested two other boys at the Salem parish, and Wisniewski was named as one of those boys. Therefore, when they investigated Kownacki, neither Mensen nor the review board was informed or was aware that Wisniewski was a victim of Kownacki’s abuse. Mensen testified that, had the 1982 report been a part of Kownacki’s file, she would have known that Wisniewski was a potential victim. She would have investigated the allegation and would have talked with Wisniewski to determine whether the abuse likely occurred.\nSection 1.5 of the Diocese’s 1993 policy regarding clerical sexual misconduct with minors provided as follows: “In the case of any disclosure of sexual misconduct with a minor, the Vicar General shall report the fact to the review administrator.” Mensen testified that the policy included all sexual misconduct regardless of whether it occurred before or after the Diocese adopted the policy. She further testified that the Diocese violated its policy when it did not disclose the information in its possession that detailed additional, undisclosed allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct perpetrated by Kownacki, including his molestation of Wisniewski. Gregory testified that the missing documents should have been kept in Kownacki’s personnel file, but they were not.\nAt the trial, Margasen denied seeing the 1982 confidential memo until after Wisniewski filed his lawsuit against the Diocese, but he admitted that he was aware of some of Kownacki’s other deviant sexual practices back in 1984, including the information contained in Sullivan’s 1973 notes. He admitted that he never reported that information to the review board at any time even though he had a duty under the Diocese’s 1993 policy to do so. He admitted that he breached the policy and withheld information from the review board, a policy that he helped draft.\nrv\nWisniewski’s Injuries\nMeanwhile, after Wisniewski moved away from Salem, he completed college and went to work in the healthcare industry at a hospital in Champaign, Illinois. He met and fell in love with his wife, Carol. They were married in 1984 and had two children together. Their daughter, Ashley, was born in October of 1987, and at the time of the trial, she was in her junior year at the University of Illinois. Their son, Andrew, was born in April of 1989, and he suffered from autism. Wisniewski testified that although his son was fairly high functioning, his son’s autism prevented him from living on his own. Wisniewski suspected that their son would have to live with them the remainder of his life.\nWisniewski was successful at his chosen career and was promoted to be the director of his department at the hospital. Wisniewski testified that until 2002, he was happy and was leading a healthy and productive life. He and Carol had problems from time to time, and they faced the challenges of raising an autistic child, but they worked through and dealt with their problems. He enjoyed his family and being around people. At work, he effectively interacted with upper management and corporate executives. He was successful at repressing his memories of Kownacki’s sexual abuse. Carol testified that Wisniewski had been a great father and had been actively involved in their children’s lives. Wisniewski was a hard worker, he made Carol laugh, and she made him laugh.\nIn 2002, however, Wisniewski’s life changed. Carol and Wisniewski testified that, in early 2002, the national news carried stories about priests in Boston, Massachusetts, who had molested children. The reports were prominent in the national news. Wisniewski became overwhelmed with the scandal and could not get it out of his mind. He was particularly troubled by reports that the Boston priests had abused many victims. Thoughts of his own abuse continually came up in his mind. In the past he had successfully put those thoughts aside, but now he could not suppress the memories. Based on the news reports concerning the Boston priests, Wisniewski began to wonder if Kownacki had abused other victims either before or after his abuse. He became anxious, uptight, irritable, and overwhelmed with a feeling of guilt that there could have been more victims after he had been abused. Wisniewski started having trouble sleeping and began having nightmares. His memories and thoughts of Kownacki’s abuse preoccupied his thinking.\nWisniewski had never told anyone what Kownacki had done to him. When the Boston priest scandal became national news, Carol read a lot of news articles about it, and one evening, she asked Wisniewski, “Father Ray never did anything to you, did he?” Wisniewski intended to go to his grave never saying anything to anyone about Kownacki’s molestation, but Carol’s question caught him off guard. He told her that he had been abused by Kownacki, beginning when he was 12 years old and continuing until he was about 17.\nCarol testified that she felt devastated and asked Wisniewski why he had never said anything. Wisniewski told her about Kownacki’s threats and told her that he had blocked it out of his mind. Carol testified, “It was like it was just buried in there and he built up a wall around himself.” They spent most of that night crying, talking, and trying to make sense out of it.\nCarol also testified that she noticed changes in Wisniewski’s personality. Wisniewski became withdrawn and irritable and no longer smiled, and his condition got worse over time. Carol testified that Wisniewski’s condition was “awful” and “unbearable.” He was short-tempered with her and their children, had lost confidence in himself, and started suffering from panic attacks and nightmares. He was no longer the person she had fallen in love with and married. The revelation of Kownacki’s abuse had affected her, their marriage, their family, and their faith.\nIn May of 2002, Wisniewski sought help from a psychiatrist, David Kopacz. Kopacz testified that Wisniewski came to see him because he had been very upset “about the media coverage of sexual abuse in the Catholic church because he was abused by a priest when he was a boy.” Kopacz described Wisniewski’s symptoms as feeling overwhelmed, reliving specific episodes of abuse, having nightmares, waking up screaming, and not being able to forget what had happened in the past. Wisniewski tried to avoid the news because it was upsetting him more and more. Wisniewski told Kopacz that he had lost his faith in God and in the Church. According to Kopacz, there was no indication in Wisniewski’s history after he went to college of any significant problems in functioning or coping in his life until the media coverage in early 2002.\nKopacz testified that Wisniewski came from a devout Catholic family that respected and integrated their church’s priest into the family’s life. Kopacz explained that, as a child, Wisniewski was very submissive and was programmed to believe everything Kownacki said. According to Kopacz, Kownacki used threats, coercion, and manipulation to alter Wisniewski’s sense of reality. Kopacz initially made a temporary diagnosis that Wisniewski suffered from an adjustment disorder and anxiety, but he later concluded that he suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder that was a direct result of the childhood sexual abuse perpetrated by Kownacki. The posttraumatic stress disorder first manifested itself in 2002, one or two months before his diagnosis. Kopacz rated Wisniewski’s symptoms on the border between moderate and severe. Kopacz prescribed Wisniewski medications to help him sleep and to help with his anxiety.\nOn May 24, 2002, Wisniewski discussed with Kopacz whether he should inform his parents of the abuse, stating that he hoped to feel better after telling his parents. In addition, Wisniewski told Kopacz that he had been looking into some background information on how much the Diocese had known about Kownacki before he was transferred to Salem. On July 4, 2002, Wisniewski told his parents that Kownacki had molested him when he was a boy. His parents had no idea that Kownacki had abused him. They asked him why he had never said anything, and he told them of Kownacki’s threats. In addition, he said he was embarrassed and just could not tell them.\nAfter July 4, 2002, Marcy noticed Wisniewski losing weight. In addition, she testified that Wisniewski had always been a quiet person but that he spoke even less after July 4, 2002. After Wisniewski’s disclosure to his parents, he rarely talked with his wife about the abuse. He refused to discuss it. Carol testified that Wisniewski was getting less than two hours of sleep each night, and she was worried that their family was not going to make it. On July 31, 2002, Wisniewski lost his job at the hospital for reasons unrelated to his lawsuit against the Diocese, and he and Carol subsequently opened a custom picture-framing business in Champaign.\nWisniewski continued to wonder what the Diocese knew about Kownacki before it transferred him to Salem, and he decided to take steps to find out. He did not believe that the Diocese would freely give him that information. He contacted an attorney, and on October 24, 2002, he filed his lawsuit against the Diocese. He testified that he filed the lawsuit to get the answers he wanted, and he hoped that some answers would help relieve his symptoms and guilt. Kopacz last saw Wisniewski on December 13, 2002. At that time, he still suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder.\nPrior to filing the lawsuit, neither Wisniewski nor his parents knew that Kownacki had been removed from active ministry by the review board. Kownacki continued to send Wisniewski and his parents Christmas cards until Christmas of 2001. He signed the Christmas cards “Fr. Ray.” They sent him cards in return, including birthday cards. No one from the Diocese ever contacted them to tell them that Kownacki had been removed and that they had information that Kownacki might have abused Wisniewski.\nDr. Peterson, a psychiatrist, evaluated Wisniewski for the purpose of giving an opinion at the trial about whether Wisniewski had experienced any psychological injury as a consequence of Kownacki’s sexual molestation and, if so, when Wisniewski understood he was injured and whether he needed treatment. Peterson testified that children who have experienced prolonged sexual abuse often suffer psychological difficulty, such as major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance abuse problems, and problems with their sexual functioning. They also frequently have many internal difficulties that they have a hard time expressing, and their issues stem from trying to make sense out of situations that should have never happened.\nPeterson performed a comprehensive psychiatric assessment of Wisniewski that included obtaining his history. The facts that Wisniewski came from a devout Catholic family and that the molester was a priest were significant to Peterson. He testified that serial sexual abusers often get to know a family or they find children who are vulnerable in some way. When Wisniewski was growing up, his father was on the road often for business. In addition, the priest stood in the role of a special envoy between God and the family and was acting in a very important role in the spiritual life of Wisniewski’s family. Wisniewski’s parents trusted the priest and were disarmed by his position in the church. Peterson testified that this situation set up a power imbalance between Kownacki and Wisniewski which enabled Kownacki to very easily manipulate Wisniewski.\nPeterson testified that Wisniewski did not initially appreciate or know that he was harmed because the priest overwhelmed him and because Wisniewski came to believe that he was actually acting in a positive way to help the priest. In Peterson’s opinion, Wisniewski did not report the conduct to his parents because of Kownacki’s position as the envoy between God and Wisniewski’s family; he wielded incredible emotional and spiritual power. Wisniewski was 12 or 13 years old, which, psychologically, was a latency period when he was learning about morals and about what was right and wrong. Peterson explained that the priest, who was a hero to Wisniewski, told Wisniewski to do things that he was uncomfortable with but that the priest reassured him that it was not wrong.\nIn addition to interviewing Wisniewski, Peterson also gave Wisniewski a series of psychological tests. Peterson concluded that Wisniewski had experienced significant psychological trauma as a result of the sexual abuse he endured. Wisniewski suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, chronic type of delayed onset, and he was experiencing a major depressive disorder with prominent anxiety.\nPeterson believed that Wisniewski’s posttraumatic stress disorder manifested itself when the media publicized the Boston priest scandal in January of 2002 and when his wife asked him directly about his experience. Prior to that time, “he never really thought about it.” Peterson did not find any evidence that Wisniewski exhibited any criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder prior to January of 2002.\nPeterson concluded that the repeated episodes of child molestation that started when Wisniewski was 12 caused him to develop posttraumatic stress disorder that did not manifest itself until 2002. According to Peterson, Wisniewski’s mind had utilized defense mechanisms to minimize the effects of the abuse. Wisniewski came to believe that his abuser was right and that Wisniewski helped Kownacki. He accepted that Kownacki’s affection toward him was a good thing, and while he never fully forgot the sexual acts themselves, his main defense mechanism was believing that what he did was helpful to the priest.\nPeterson explained that a lot of children and adults will keep such things inside until something pierces their defense mechanisms and overwhelms their psychological need to look away. In Wisniewski’s case, Peterson testified, one of the things that seemed to comfort Wisniewski was that he believed that he was the only one who had been abused by Kownacki. In January of 2002, however, when sexual abuse by priests was national news, Wisniewski was faced with the possibility that potentially many others had been sexually abused. Peterson explained that the news stories overwhelmed Wisniewski’s defenses and that when his wife directly asked him if he had been abused, he realized that what he had done was not to help the priest but that he had been manipulated and had been “misused.” At that point, Wisniewski started experiencing the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, including nightmares about what had happened, depression, loss of energy and focus, difficulty sleeping, persistent suicidal thoughts, and recollections about his abuse that intruded on his relationship with his wife.\nPeterson testified that in his opinion, within a reasonable degree of medical certainty, when all of these events occurred in 2002, Wisniewski first became aware that he had sustained an injury as a result of the repeated acts of sexual molestation he suffered as a child. According to Peterson, Wisniewski needed two basic types of treatment. First, he needed medications to help relieve his depression and his anxiety disorder, including a combination of antidepressants, anti-anxiety agents, and perhaps some antiobsessional agents. He would need to be on such medications for 5 to 10 years at a minimum. Second, Wisniewski needed psychotherapy focused on the things that were most troubling to him and to his family as a consequence of realizing he was harmed. The psychotherapy Wisniewski needed would be “quite lengthy.”\nV\nTrial Court Proceedings and Jury Trial\nWisniewski filed his complaint against the Diocese on October 24, 2002, alleging several theories of liability. In addition, he alleged that the Diocese fraudulently concealed his cause of action against it and that, therefore, the Diocese should be barred from asserting as a defense the statute of limitations or the statute of repose. The Diocese subsequently filed a motion for a summary judgment that raised the statute of limitations and the statute of repose. The circuit court denied the Diocese’s motion for a summary judgment. The circuit court held that Wisniewski’s complaint was untimely under the relevant statutes of limitations and repose. However, the circuit court denied the Diocese’s motion for a summary judgment because it found that Wisniewski had raised a question of fact to be determined by the jury concerning whether the Diocese fraudulently concealed his cause of action. Wisniewski had also raised a question of fact concerning whether the Diocese should be barred from asserting the statutes of limitations and repose based on the doctrines of equitable estoppel or equitable tolling.\nAt the juxy trial, the circuit court instructed the jury that it would first have to determine whether the Diocese fraudulently concealed Wisniewski’s cause of action. The jury was instructed that it could only address the issues of liability and damages if it found in Wisniewski’s favor on the issue of fraudulent concealment. While the jury deliberated, the circuit court entered a separate order, ruling that Wisniewski’s claims against the Diocese were not barred by the statute of limitations or the statute of repose. The circuit court found that Wisniewski had established equitable estoppel and equitable tolling by clear and convincing evidence. The jury then returned a verdict finding that the Diocese fraudulently concealed Wisniewski’s cause of action against it and finding that the Diocese was liable for Wisniewski’s injuries. The jury awarded Wisniewski $2.4 million in compensatory damages and $2.6 million for punitive damages. The Diocese filed a motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict (n.o.v.) that raised, among other issues, the statute of limitations and the statute of repose. The circuit court denied the Diocese’s motion for a judgment n.o.v. The Diocese appeals.\nANALYSIS\nThe Diocese raises the following arguments on appeal: (I) that, as a matter of law, Wisniewski’s claims are time-barred by the relevant statute of repose and statute of limitations, (II) that Wisniewski’s claims were legally insufficient, (III) that the circuit court abused its discretion in denying its request to perform a mental examination of Wisniewski pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 215 (eff. July 1, 2002), and (IV) that the circuit court abused its discretion in making certain evidentiary rulings. We will discuss each argument in turn.\nI.\nStatute of Repose and Statute of Limitations\nThe first arguments that the Diocese raises on appeal are that Wisniewski’s claims against it are time-barred as a matter of law by the relevant statute of repose and statute of limitations. The Diocese also argues that, as a matter of law, neither the fraudulent concealment statute nor the common law discovery rule tolled the running of the statute of repose or the statute of limitations. The Diocese concludes that the circuit court, therefore, should have granted its motion for a judgment n.o.v. at the conclusion of the trial because Wisniewski’s claims were untimely.\nAt the outset, we note that the Diocese does not contend on appeal that the jury was improperly instructed on any of the issues it decided; therefore, we will assume that the jury was properly instructed. See Ford v. Baker, 61 Ill. App. 3d 45, 46, 377 N.E.2d 853, 854 (1978). When the jury has been properly instructed, we are reluctant to set aside the jury’s verdict, because many factors, including the credibility of the witnesses, are considered by the jury in reaching its verdict. See Ford, 61 Ill. App. 3d at 46, 377 N.E.2d at 854 (“When the jury has been properly instructed, both trial and reviewing courts are reluctant to set aside the amount of the jury verdict.”).\nA statute of repose and a statute of limitations are separate and distinct statutes that place a limitation on the time in which a plaintiff has to file his or her lawsuit. The difference between a statute of limitations and a statute of repose is that “a statute of limitations governs the time within which lawsuits may be commenced after a cause of action has accrued, while a statute of repose extinguishes the action itself after a fixed period of time, regardless of when the action accrued.” DeLuna v. Burciaga, 223 Ill. 2d 49, 61, 857 N.E.2d 229, 237 (2006).\nIn general, the statute of limitations begins to run on the date the plaintiffs cause of action accrues, and in personal injury actions, that usually occurs on the date of the injury. Golla v. General Motors Corp., 167 Ill. 2d 353, 360, 657 N.E.2d 894, 898 (1995). However, the application of this general rule could be unduly harsh if it barred a plaintiff from bringing suit before the plaintiff was even aware that he was injured. Golla, 167 Ill. 2d at 360, 657 N.E.2d at 898. “To alleviate the harsh consequences that would flow from literal application of the limitations period, the judiciary created the ‘discovery rule,’ ” which “postponed] the commencement of the relevant statute of limitations until the injured plaintiff knows or reasonably should know that he has been injured and that his injury was wrongfully caused.” Golla, 167 Ill. 2d at 360-61, 657 N.E.2d at 898.\nA statute of repose, however, is designed to place an outer limit on the “long tail” of liability created by the common law discovery rule. Hester v. Diaz, 346 Ill. App. 3d 550, 553, 805 N.E.2d 255, 259 (2004). Accordingly, a statute of repose “is intended to terminate the possibility of liability after a defined period of time, regardless of a potential plaintiffs lack of knowledge of his or her cause of action.” Ferguson v. McKenzie, 202 Ill. 2d 304, 311, 780 N.E.2d 660, 664 (2001). Statutes of repose do not incorporate the discovery rule and generally terminate claims regardless of a plaintiffs lack of knowledge of his or her cause of action. Goodman v. Harbor Market, Ltd., 278 Ill. App. 3d 684, 690-91, 663 N.E.2d 13, 18 (1995).\nAlthough a statute of repose does not normally incorporate the discovery rule, a statute of repose, nonetheless, can be tolled if a plaintiff does not discover his claim due to fraudulent concealment on the part of the defendant. In DeLuna, the Illinois Supreme Court held that fraudulent concealment can toll the running of a statute of repose because “there would be an obvious and gross injustice in a rule that allows a defendant — particularly a defendant who stands in a fiduciary relationship to the plaintiff — to conceal the plaintiffs cause of action and then benefit from a statute of repose.” DeLuna, 223 Ill. 2d at 71, 857 N.E.2d at 242.\nIn the present case, Wisniewski was abused in the 1970s and maintained that he did not discover his claim until 2002. In order to toll the running of the statute of limitations under the common law discovery rule, Wisniewski was required to prove that he neither knew nor reasonably should have known that he had been injured and that his injury was wrongfully caused until 2002. To toll the running of the statute of repose, however, under the fraudulent concealment statute, Wisniewski had to prove not only that he did not discover his claim until 2002 but also that his failure to discover his claim was due to fraudulent concealment committed by the Diocese.\nWe begin our analysis of the circuit court’s denial of the Diocese’s motion for a judgment n.o.v. with a discussion of the applicable statute of repose and the jury’s finding of fraudulent concealment. We will then discuss the statute of limitations and application of the common law discovery rule to the facts of the case. Based on our analysis, we conclude that the circuit court properly denied the Diocese’s motion for a judgment n.o.v. on the issues concerning the timeliness of Wisniewski’s claim. We find that, under the facts of this case, the application of the fraudulent concealment statute and the common law discovery rule presented factual issues for the jury to consider, not legal issues that the circuit court was required to find in the Diocese’s favor as a matter of law.\nA.\nStatute of Repose\nPrior to January 1, 1991, Illinois did not have a statute of repose applicable to personal injury claims arising from childhood sexual abuse. On January 1, 1991, the Illinois General Assembly added section 13 — 202.2 to the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure (the Code) (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 110, par. 13 — 202.2), which established a statute of repose applicable to childhood sexual abuse cases. When enacted in 1991, section 13 — 202.2(b) read as follows:\n“(b) An action for damages for personal injury based on childhood sexual abuse must be commenced within 2 years of the date the person abused discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should discover that the act of childhood sexual abuse occurred and that the injury was caused by the childhood sexual abuse, but in no event may an action for personal injury based on childhood sexual abuse be commenced more than 12 years after the date on which the person abused attains the age of 18 years.” Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 110, par. 13 — 202.2(b).\nAccordingly, section 13 — 202.2(b), as enacted in 1991, contained a 2-year statute of limitations and a 12-year statute of repose.\nThe effect of the enactment of the 1991 statute of repose contained in section 13 — 202.2 was “to bar anyone over the age of 30 from bringing an action for personal injury based on childhood sexual abuse.” Doe A. v. Diocese of Dallas, 234 Ill. 2d 393, 408, 917 N.E.2d 475, 484 (2009). In the present case, Wisniewski turned 30 on March 6, 1991, approximately two months after the legislature enacted the statute of repose.\nEffective January 1, 1994, the legislature eliminated the 12-year statute of repose for childhood sexual abuse claims. After the 1994 amendment, section 13 — 202.2(b) provided as follows:\n“(b) An action for damages for personal injury based on childhood sexual abuse must be commenced within 2 years of the date the person abused discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should discover that the act of childhood sexual abuse occurred and that the injury was caused by the childhood sexual abuse.” 735 ILCS 5/13 — 202.2(b) (West 1994).\nHowever, the legislature’s repeal of the statute of repose is not applied retroactively to revive claims that had expired prior to the repeal of the statute of repose. The Illinois Supreme Court has held that the Illinois Constitution does not permit retroactive application of amendments to section 13 — 202.2(b) to revive otherwise time-barred claims for childhood sexual abuse. Diocese of Dallas, 234 Ill. 2d at 409, 917 N.E.2d at 484. The court stated, “ ‘[I]f the claims were time-barred under the old law, they remained time-barred even after the repose period was abolished by the legislature.’ ” Diocese of Dallas, 234 Ill. 2d at 409, 917 N.E.2d at 484 (quoting M.E.H. v. L.H., 177 Ill. 2d 207, 215, 685 N.E.2d 335, 339 (1997)). Accordingly, for purposes of analyzing the timeliness of Wisniewski’s claim with respect to the statute of repose, we must apply the 1991 version of section 13 — 202.2 of the Code to his claim.\nUnder the 1991 statute of repose, Wisniewski had until he turned 30 to file his action against the Diocese, but he did not file his claim until 2002, when he was 41 years old. In response to the statute of repose, Wisniewski invoked the fraudulent concealment statute and maintained that he did not discover that he was injured and did not discover the Diocese’s wrongful conduct until 2002 because of the Diocese’s fraudulent concealment. The issue of fraudulent concealment was submitted to the jury, and the jury decided the issue in Wisniewski’s favor.\n1.\nThe Jury’s Finding of Fraudulent Concealment\nAs we stated, prior to the trial, the Diocese filed a motion for a summary judgment that raised the statute of repose. The circuit court, however, denied the Diocese’s motion, finding that there were material issues of fact concerning the application of the fraudulent concealment statute to toll the running of the statute of repose. The circuit court determined that it would submit the issue of fraudulent concealment to the jury to be decided before the jury considered issues of liability and damages.\nAt the trial, the jury resolved the issue of fraudulent concealment in Wisniewski’s favor by entering a verdict deciding that issue in his favor. The jury also entered a general verdict in Wisniewski’s favor awarding damages. At the conclusion of the trial, the Diocese filed a motion for a judgment n.o.v., arguing, among other things, that the evidence did not establish fraudulent concealment as a matter of law. The circuit court denied the Diocese’s motion for a judgment n.o.v., and on appeal, the Diocese argues that the circuit court erred in denying the motion. Therefore, the fraudulent concealment issue is presented to us on appeal by way of the circuit court’s denial of a motion for a judgment n.o.v.\nA trial court’s ruling on a motion for a judgment n.o.v. is subject to a de novo standard of review. McClure v. Owens Corning Fiberglas Corp., 188 Ill. 2d 102, 132, 720 N.E.2d 242, 257 (1999). A judgment n.o.v. is properly entered only in those limited cases where “all of the evidence, when viewed in its aspect most favorable to the opponent, so overwhelmingly favors movant that no contrary verdict based on that evidence could ever stand.” Pedrick v. Peoria &amp; Eastern R.R. Co., 37 Ill. 2d 494, 510, 229 N.E.2d 504, 513-14 (1967). “In ruling on a motion for a judgment n.o.v., a court does not weigh the evidence, nor is it concerned with the credibility of the witnesses; rather it may only consider the evidence, and any inferences therefrom, in the light most favorable to the party resisting the motion.” Maple v. Gustafson, 151 Ill. 2d 445, 453, 603 N.E.2d 508, 512 (1992). “Most importantly, a judgment n.o.v. may not be granted merely because a verdict is against the manifest weight of the evidence.” Maple, 151 Ill. 2d at 453, 603 N.E.2d at 512. Therefore, in the present case, we are asked to determine, among other issues, whether the evidence justified the submission of the fraudulent concealment issue to the jury. See Valdes v. Karoll’s, Inc., 277 F.2d 637, 638 (7th Cir. 1960). Applying this standard, we cannot say that the evidence supports only one reasonable conclusion in the Diocese’s favor on the issue of fraudulent concealment. Rather, we find that there was ample evidence to support the jury’s verdict on that issue.\nThe doctrine of fraudulent concealment is codified in section 13 — 215 of the Code, and it provides, “If a person liable to an action fraudulently conceals the cause of such action from the knowledge of the person entitled thereto, the action may be commenced at any time within 5 years after the person entitled to bring the same discovers that he or she has such cause of action, and not afterwards.” 735 ILCS 5/13 — 215 (West 2008). “Fraudulent concealment, as codified in section 13 — 215, is not a cause of action in and of itself; rather, it acts as an exception to the time limitations imposed on other, underlying causes of action.” Cangemi v. Advocate South Suburban Hospital, 364 Ill. App. 3d 446, 459, 845 N.E.2d 792, 805 (2006).\n“The concealment contemplated in section 13 — 215 must consist of affirmative acts or representations which are calculated to lull or induce a claimant into delaying filing of his claim or to prevent a claimant from discovering his claim.” Smith v. Cook County Hospital, 164 Ill. App. 3d 857, 862, 518 N.E.2d 336, 340 (1987). “A plaintiff must plead and prove that the defendant made misrepresentations or performed acts which were known to be false, with the intent to deceive the plaintiff, and upon which the plaintiff detrimentally relied.” Orlak v. Loyola University Health System, 228 Ill. 2d 1, 18, 885 N.E.2d 999, 1009 (2007).\nAs a general rule, mere silence on the part of the defendant and a failure by the plaintiff to learn of the cause of action are not enough to establish fraudulent concealment. Chicago Park District v. Kenroy, Inc., 78 Ill. 2d 555, 561, 402 N.E.2d 181, 185 (1980). However, there is an exception to this general rule when there is a fiduciary or trust or other confidential relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant. Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 562, 402 N.E.2d at 185. The prevailing rule is that when such a relationship exists, the person occupying the position of fiduciary or of confidence is under a duty to reveal the facts to the plaintiff, and his silence is as fraudulent as an actual affirmative false representation or act. Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 562, 402 N.E.2d at 185. Silence by a person in a position of trust concerning the facts giving rise to a cause of action amounts to fraudulent concealment. Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 562, 402 N.E.2d at 185.\nOn appeal, the Diocese argues that the evidence was insufficient to submit the issue of fraudulent concealment to the jury because there was no evidence presented at the trial that the Diocese made any misrepresentations directly to Wisniewski that lulled him into delaying the filing of his claim or prevented him from discovering he had a claim against the Diocese. In addition, the Diocese maintains that it was not in a fiduciary, special, or confidential relationship with Wisniewski and that, therefore, its silence with respect to Wisniewski’s claim does not support a finding that it fraudulently concealed the claim. We disagree. When viewing the evidence presented at the trial in the light most favorable to Wisniewski, we cannot conclude that the evidence so overwhelmingly favors the Diocese on the issue of fraudulent concealment that the jury’s verdict cannot stand.\nAt the trial, the circuit court instructed the jury to first decide whether the Diocese fraudulently concealed the cause of action from Wisniewski before it considered issues of liability and damages. The jury instructions defined “fraudulent concealment” as follows:\n“a) Affirmative acts or representations made by the defendant that were designed to prevent and, in fact, did prevent! ] plaintiff from discovering his claim against the defendant; or\nb) The defendant failed to disclose all material facts concerning the existence of plaintiffs cause of action against the defendant and there was a special relationship that existed between plaintiff and defendant whereby the plaintiff placed trust and confidence in defendant thereby placing defendant in a position of influence and superiority over plaintiff.”\nThe jury instructions further stated that Wisniewski had the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the Diocese fraudulently concealed his cause of action and that he commenced his cause of action against the Diocese within five years of discovering it. As noted above, the Diocese does not take issue with the jury instructions, and we believe that Wisniewski presented evidence from which the jury could find in his favor on the issue of fraudulent concealment as defined in the jury instructions.\nThe first prong of the jury instruction defining fraudulent concealment stated that fraudulent concealment included “acts or representations made by the defendant that were designed to prevent and, in fact, did prevent! ] plaintiff from discovering his claim against the defendant.” The Diocese maintains that, as a matter of law, evidence of acts or representations its officers made with respect to Kownacki’s qualifications to be a priest after Wisniewski left the Salem parish in 1980 cannot support the jury’s finding of fraudulent concealment because there was no evidence presented that Wisniewski was aware of the officers’ acts or representations that occurred after he left the Salem parish. With respect to the affirmative representations made by Kownacki, i.e., that the abuse was a good thing that helped the priest, the Diocese argues that Wisniewski did not present any evidence that any officer or principal of the Diocese knew of Kownacki’s representations to Wisniewski at the time he made them. Therefore, the Diocese concludes, Kownacki’s representations to Wisniewski cannot constitute affirmative acts of fraudulent concealment on the part of the Diocese as defined under the first prong of the fraudulent concealment definition. See Barbour v. South Chicago Community Hospital, 156 Ill. App. 3d 324, 330-31, 509 N.E.2d 558, 563 (1987) (“Illinois courts, including the supreme court, have refused to expand *** section 13 — 215 to include an unknowing principal.”).\nWe need not determine whether Wisniewski presented sufficient evidence to establish fraudulent concealment under the first prong of the definition instruction because we hold that Wisniewski presented sufficient evidence to establish fraudulent concealment under the second prong of the definition instruction. See, e.g., Krklus v. Stanley, 359 Ill. App. 3d 471, 479, 833 N.E.2d 952, 959 (2005) (when there is a general verdict after more than one theory has been presented to a jury, the verdict will be upheld on appeal if there was sufficient evidence to sustain any of the theories presented).\nThe second prong of the fraudulent concealment definition instruction stated that fraudulent concealment occurs if the “defendant failed to disclose all material facts concerning the existence of plaintiff’s cause of action against the defendant and there was a special relationship that existed between plaintiff and defendant whereby the plaintiff placed trust and confidence in defendant thereby placing defendant in a position of influence and superiority over plaintiff.” In challenging a finding of fraudulent concealment under the second prong of the definition instruction, the Diocese argues that, as a matter of law, it did not have a special relationship with Wisniewski or occupy a position of trust. We disagree. We believe that the issue of whether a relationship of trust existed between Wisniewski and the Diocese was not an issue to be decided by the court as a matter of law but was a factual issue that was properly submitted to the jury to decide.\na.\nEvidence of a Special Relationship That Placed the Diocese and Its Officers and Agents in a Position of Influence and Superiority Over Wisniewski\nThe jury heard evidence that the Diocese, its officers, its priests, and its parish in Salem, Illinois, played a central role in Wisniewski’s life from the time his parents first moved to Salem when he was a young boy and throughout his childhood. The family was very active in church life, and Wisniewski and his siblings were taught to obey and believe everything the Diocese’s bishops, monsignors, and priests said to them. Wisniewski was an active parishioner and an altar boy and was taught to trust and respect the Diocese and put his faith and trust in its agents and employees. He attended the Diocese’s Catholic grade school for a number of years, worked around the parish, and expressed interest in becoming a Catholic priest.\nThe agents and employees of the Diocese were held in high esteem in Wisniewski’s family and were placed on a pedestal, and the Diocese itself fostered, promoted, and encouraged this trusting relationship by urging its parishioners to trust their priests’ “knowledge, piety, prudence, experience, and general character.” In fact, when the Diocese appointed Kownacki to the parish in Salem, the bishop, as the Diocese’s CEO, “command[ed] all, whom it may concern, to recognize [Kownacki] as such Pastor and grant [him] all necessary assistance.” The Diocese successfully garnered this trust with Wisniewski’s parents and with Wisniewski, and it is this very trust that Kownacki exploited in order to sexually abuse Wisniewski for years. The Diocese’s assertion that the evidence was insufficient for the jury to conclude that it held a position of trust over Wisniewski is entirely unconvincing. The evidence overwhelmingly established that Wisniewski placed his trust and confidence in the Diocese and that the Diocese not only accepted that trust and confidence but encouraged and promoted it.\nThe Diocese argues that Illinois courts and public policy do not recognize any duty, fiduciary or otherwise, between a parishioner and his pastor. The Diocese cites three cases in support of this argument: Dausch v. Rykse, 52 F.3d 1425, 1438-39 (7th Cir. 1994) (per curiam), Maryland Casualty Co. v. Havey, 887 F. Supp. 195, 200 (C.D. Ill. 1995), and Amato v. Greenquist, 287 Ill. App. 3d 921, 931-32, 679 N.E.2d 446, 453-54 (1997). These cases are not persuasive in the present case because they do not analyze the relationship between a parishioner and a priest or a diocese in terms of applying the fraudulent concealment statute.\nIn Amato, the plaintiff sued a pastor, a bishop, and a church organization for psychotherapy malpractice and a breach of a fiduciary duty after the plaintiff received marriage counseling from the pastor at the same time the pastor was having an affair with the plaintiffs wife. Amato, 287 Ill. App. 3d at 923, 679 N.E.2d at 448. The trial court dismissed the plaintiffs complaint for various reasons but primarily because Illinois did not recognize the tort of clergy malpractice and because the relationship between cleric and parishioner was not a fiduciary one. Amato, 287 Ill. App. 3d at 924, 679 N.E.2d at 449.\nOn appeal, the Amato court held that the first amendment “prohibited the recognition of an action for breach of fiduciary duty premised upon the counselling relationship between a cleric and a church member with whom the cleric had been sexually involved.” Amato, 287 Ill. App. 3d at 932, 679 N.E.2d at 454 (citing Dausch v. Rykse, 52 F.3d 1425, 1438 (7th Cir. 1994) (per curiam)). The court recognized that the relationship between a cleric and a parishioner “reflects many aspects of a fiduciary one,” but it held that under Illinois law, a contention that a cleric has breached his duty as a fiduciary is not actionable because religion is the foundation for that claim. Amato, 287 Ill. App. 3d at 932, 679 N.E.2d at 454. The court noted that in Illinois the courts have refused to entertain similar claims of “clergy malpractice” because “the first amendment’s free exercise clause prohibits courts from considering claims requiring the interpretation of religious doctrine.” Amato, 287 Ill. App. 3d at 925-26, 679 N.E.2d at 450.\nIn Maryland Casualty Co., the court had to determine an insurance company’s duty to defend a complaint filed by parishioners against a priest and the Diocese of Springfield. Maryland Casualty Co., 887 F. Supp. at 196. The complaint alleged that the priest sexually abused the parishioners when they were approximately 11 or 12 years old. Maryland Casualty Co., 887 F. Supp. at 196. In analyzing whether the parishioners could recover under a theory that the priest negligently breached his duties as a priest, the court stated, “Illinois courts have refused to create a legally recognized duty between clergymen and their congregation.” Maryland Casualty Co., 887 F. Supp. at 200 (citing Dausch v. Rykse, 52 F.3d 1425 (7th Cir. 1994) (per curiam)). The court concluded that without that duty, the parishioners could not maintain an action for the negligent infliction of emotional distress or for the breach of a fiduciary duty. Therefore, the insurance company did not have a duty to defend those claims because they did not state a claim for which relief could be granted. Maryland Casualty Co., 887 F. Supp. at 200.\nIn Dausch, a member of a church’s congregation filed a claim against the church and its pastor, alleging that the pastor improperly engaged in sexual relations with her when she sought counseling. Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1427. The plaintiff alleged, among other things, that the pastor “held himself out *** to be a duly qualified person engaged in providing psychological counseling” and committed “professional negligence” by engaging in “sexual relations” with her during counseling sessions. Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1427-28. The trial court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint for a failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1428.\nOn appeal, the Dausch court noted that Illinois has rejected a cause of action for clergy malpractice because the evaluation of those claims would require the courts to evaluate religious tenets. Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1432 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). However, the court also noted that the courts’ refusal to examine the conduct of the clergy “has not been extended to situations in which the conduct in question does not bear such a direct relationship to the doctrinal or organizational aspects of religious practice.” Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1432 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Illinois allows judicial scrutiny of the conduct of clergy that “does not implicate judicial assessment of the tenets of a particular religion or a determination of whether a particular litigant has adhered to those tenets.” Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1433 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Under those circumstances, the sole inquiry is whether the individual has engaged in conduct that the state has deemed harmful. Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1433 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). In other words, “[t]ort claims for behavior by a cleric that does not require the examination of religious doctrine are cognizable.” Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1433 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nIn addressing the plaintiff’s allegation that the defendants breached a fiduciary duty they owed to her, the Dausch court held that alleging a breach of a fiduciary relationship “was simply an elliptical way of alleging clergy malpractice.” Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1438 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). The court stated, “If the court were to recognize such a breach of fiduciary duty, it would be required to define a reasonable duty standard and to evaluate [the pastor’s] conduct against that standard, an inquiry identical to that which Illinois has declined to undertake in the context of a clergy malpractice claim and one that is of doubtful validity under the Free Exercise Clause.” Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1438 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nThe present issue is distinguishable from the issues in Amato, Maryland Casualty Co., and Dausch because the issue in the present case is not whether Wisniewski can maintain a cause of action against the Diocese for clergy malpractice. Instead, the issue is whether there was a special relationship between Wisniewski and the Diocese for purposes of the fraudulent concealment statute, and the analysis of that issue does not involve any judicial analysis of religious doctrine or whether the Diocese adhered to religious tenets. As the court in Amato stated, the relationship between a priest and a parishioner reflects many aspects of a special or fiduciary relationship Amato, 287 Ill. App. 3d at 932, 679 N.E.2d at 454), and it is those aspects of the relationship that are relevant to the application of the fraudulent concealment statute to the facts of the present case.\nA determination that a special relationship existed between Wisniewski and the Diocese did not require the court or the jury to engage in interpretation of religious doctrine, but only to determine whether Wisniewski placed his trust and confidence in the Diocese, thereby placing the Diocese in a position of influence and superiority over him. The jury’s determination of this issue did not implicate the free exercise clause of the first amendment. The jury was asked to determine whether the special relationship existed and, if so, whether the Diocese failed to disclose all material facts concerning the existence of Wisniewski’s claim against it. To invoke the protection of the first amendment, the Diocese must assert that the conduct at issue was “rooted in religious belief.” Sanders v. Casa View Baptist Church, 134 F.3d 331, 337-38 (5th Cir. 1998). The Diocese does not and cannot contend that its silence about the abuse committed by Kownacki was a part of Catholic religious beliefs and practices. On the contrary, the evidence at the trial established that the Diocese considered Wisniewski’s abuse as “dirty laundry” that it did not want to hang out in public.\nFurthermore, contrary to the Diocese’s assertion on appeal, in affirming the circuit court’s denial of its motion for a judgment n.o.v., we are not required to hold that the Diocese has a special or fiduciary relationship, as a matter of law, with all of its parishioners. Instead, we hold that it was an issue of fact for the jury to decide. Consistent with the established standard of review for the denial of a motion for a judgment n.o.v., we hold that the jury in the present case was entitled to find, based on the evidence presented at the trial, that the Diocese held a position of trust and confidence with Wisniewski for purposes of the application of the fraudulent concealment statute.\nb.\nThe Diocese’s Failure to Disclose All Material Facts Concerning the Existence of Wisniewski’s Cause of Action Against It\nSince the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that the Diocese held a special relationship with Wisniewski, the next step in our analysis under the second prong of the fraudulent concealment definition instruction is to determine whether the jury could have concluded that the Diocese failed to disclose all material facts concerning Wisniewski’s claim against it in light of the special relationship. As noted above, the Diocese argues that Kownacki’s fraudulent representations that the sexual abuse was good and helpful to the priest do not constitute affirmative acts or representations attributable to the Diocese to support a finding of fraudulent concealment under the first prong of the definition instruction because there was no evidence that it was aware of the representations at the time they were made. However, under the facts of this case, the jury could, nonetheless, find that the Diocese’s silence after it learned that Wisniewski was abused by Kownacki constituted fraudulent concealment of Wisniewski’s cause of action under the second prong of the definition instruction.\nThe jury learned that the Diocese became aware of Kownacki’s abuse of Wisniewski as early as 1982 when the parents of the freshman boy reported to the Diocese’s officers at the chancery that their son had been abused by Kownacki. The parents reported that Kownacki represented to their son that the abuse was okay and was “a sign of friendship.” Kownacki made the freshman boy promise not to tell his parents and told the boy that he had done the same thing with Wisniewski. The jury also considered evidence that the Diocese was aware that in the 1970s Kownacki abused Gina and did so by telling her that the sexual abuse was acceptable in the eyes of God and the Church.\nAccordingly, the jury heard evidence that, in 1982, the officers of the Diocese were aware that Kownacki had sexually abused several minor parishioners, including Wisniewski, and, importantly, that a crucial element of Kownacki’s method of abuse was positive coercion, i.e., representations that the abuse was a good thing. The Diocese was aware that Kownacki made those representations as a Diocesan priest and that he used his position as its priest as an inroad for facilitating his abuse and for lending credibility to the false representations he made to his victims. In other words, the Diocese was aware that Kownacki made misrepresentations to his child victims concerning the nature of the sexual abuse, using the Diocese’s special relationship with its child parishioners to influence his victims into believing that the abuse was a good thing. This evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that the Diocese’s special relationship with Wisniewski as a St. Theresa’s parishioner created an affirmative duty on the part of the Diocese to contact Wisniewski about Kownacki’s abuse and disavow Kownacki’s representations that his abuse was good and helpful to the priest. The Diocese, however, remained silent. Considering the instructions given to the jury and viewing the evidence in light most favorable to Wisniewski, the evidence was more than sufficient for the jury to find that the Diocese’s continued silence after learning that Wisniewski was abused was the equivalent of an affirmative act of fraudulent concealment of Wisniewski’s claim against it.\nc.\nThe Diocese’s Silence Prevented Wisniewski From (1) Discovering That He Sustained an Injury and (2) Discovering That the Diocese’s Wrongful Conduct Caused His Injuries\nThe next step in our analysis is to determine whether the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find that the Diocese’s silence prevented Wisniewski from discovering his claim until 2002. The fraudulent concealment must have lulled Wisniewski into delaying the filing of his claim or prevented him from discovering his claim. See Smith v. Cook County Hospital, 164 Ill. App. 3d 857, 862, 518 N.E.2d 336, 340 (1987). We believe that the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that the Diocese’s fraudulent concealment by silence prevented Wisniewski from discovering his claim until 2002.\nOn the issue of when Wisniewski discovered his claim, the jury was instructed as follows:\n“The plaintiff is deemed to have discovered his cause of action when he both:\n1) Knows or should have known that he has sustained an injury; and\n2) That the injury was caused by the wrongful conduct of the defendant.”\nWith respect to the first prong of this definition instruction, Wisniewski presented evidence from which the jury could find that he did not know and should not have known that he sustained any injury from Kownacki’s abuse until 2002 when the Boston priest scandal became national news and that the Diocese’s silence prevented him from discovering his injuries before that time.\nThe evidence supported a finding that the specific injury that Wisniewski suffered was posttraumatic stress disorder that first manifested itself in January of 2002. A psychiatrist who examined Wisniewski, Dr. Peterson, testified that prior to 2002, Wisniewski did not exhibit any criteria for posttraumatic stress disorder because, in part, Wisniewski came to believe that Kownacki’s representations were correct and that he helped the priest by submitting to the abuse. The psychiatrist told the jury that Wisniewski accepted that Kownacki’s abuse was a good thing and that a major part of Wisniewski’s psychological defense mechanism was believing that what happened was helpful to the priest. In 2002, however, the news stories of child sexual abuse by Boston priests overwhelmed Wisniewski’s defenses, and he then, for the first time, began suffering from the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, including nightmares, depression, loss of energy and focus, difficulty sleeping, persistent suicidal thoughts, and recollections about his abuse that interfered with his everyday life. Peterson testified that in his opinion, to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, in 2002, Wisniewski first became aware that he had sustained an injury as a result of the repeated acts of sexual molestation committed by the Diocese’s priest.\nLikewise, another psychiatrist, Dr. Kopacz, testified that there was no indication in Wisniewski’s history after he left the Salem parish of any significant problems in functioning or coping in his fife until the media coverage of the Boston priest scandal in early 2002. Kopacz explained to the jury that, as a child, Wisniewski was very submissive and was programmed to believe everything Kownacki said, which allowed Kownacki to manipulate Wisniewski’s sense of reality. However, the media coverage of the Boston scandal overwhelmed Wisniewski, and he began experiencing posttraumatic stress disorder.\nThe jury could have concluded from this evidence that the Diocese’s fraudulent concealment by silence after it learned of Wisniewski’s abuse prevented Wisniewski from discovering his injuries until 2002. The Diocese, having knowledge of Kownacki’s abuse and false representations in 1982, failed to contact Wisniewski and address the abuse or address Kownacki’s representations concerning the nature of the abuse Kownacki made as its priest. The jury could have found this evidence particularly compelling given (1) the special relationship that existed between the Diocese and Wisniewski, (2) that Kownacki’s manipulation of Wisniewski’s perception of reality occurred when Wisniewski was a young and impressionable parishioner, and (3) that Kownacki exploited the Diocese’s special relationship with Wisniewski in order to abuse Wisniewski and manipulate his sense of reality. Under these facts, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to find in Wisniewski’s favor on the issue of when he is deemed to have discovered his cause of action.\nFurthermore, under the second prong of the jury instruction that defined when Wisniewski is deemed to have discovered his claim, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that Wisniewski had no reason to know of or suspect any wrongdoing by the Diocese prior to 2002. There was no evidence to suggest that Wisniewski was aware or should have been aware that the officers of the Diocese actually knew of Kownacki’s pedophile tendencies when it appointed him as the parish priest and knew of Kownacki’s use of false representations as a positive coercion tactic to facilitate his abuse.\nWe find Chicago Park District v. Kenroy, Inc., 78 Ill. 2d 555, 563, 402 N.E.2d 181, 185 (1980), instructive in analyzing the circuit court’s denial of the Diocese’s motion for a judgment n.o.v. on the issue of fraudulent concealment. In Chicago Park District, a park district initiated eminent domain proceedings to acquire a parcel of real property owned by the defendants. Prior to the proceedings, however, the defendants bribed a city alderman to rezone the property, which increased its value by $5 million. Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 559, 402 N.E.2d at 183. The City of Chicago and the park district did not discover the fraud until several years later, after which they brought a lawsuit against the defendants, alleging the fraud and seeking the imposition of a constructive trust and to recover actual and punitive damages. Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 559-60, 402 N.E.2d at 183-84. The defendants raised the applicable statute of limitations, and one of the issues on appeal was whether the complaint adequately alleged fraudulent concealment sufficient to toll the statute of limitations. Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 560, 402 N.E.2d at 184.\nIn holding that the complaint sufficiently pled fraudulent concealment, the court initially noted that silence ordinarily does not constitute fraudulent concealment, but when a person who is in a position of trust remains silent when he ought to speak, he can be found to have fraudulently concealed. Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 562, 402 N.E.2d at 185. The court stated that the alderman who took the bribe occupied a fiduciary relationship with the city. Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 562, 402 N.E.2d at 185. The court further stated that according to the allegations in the complaint, “there was no apparent reason for the City to suspect that its fiduciary *** had entered into a scheme of bribery and fraud with the defendants until it became apparent during” the alderman’s prosecution for failing to report bribes on his income taxes. Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 562, 402 N.E.2d at 185. In ruling that the defendants could not utilize the statute of limitations to “protect their allegedly ill-gotten gains,” the court stated, “To hold that the City was obliged to search for the misfeasance of its duly elected public official, absent a prior indication of wrongdoing, would require it to presume unfaithfulness on the part of its fiduciary.” Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 563, 402 N.E.2d at 185-86.\nLikewise, in the present case, the jury was presented with evidence of a relationship of trust between the Diocese and Wisniewski, with Wisniewski placing his trust and confidence in the Diocese, its agents, and its employees. The evidence further supported a finding that Wisniewski had no reason to suspect that the Diocese, in fact, knew of Kownacki’s history of abusing the Diocese’s relationship of trust with its parishioners in order to commit child sexual abuse. When the Diocese learned of Wisniewski’s sexual abuse, it remained silent, and Wisniewski had no reason to suspect that the Diocese betrayed his trust and confidence. Under these circumstances, we will not second-guess the jury’s verdict.\nThe Diocese argues that even if there was a relationship of trust and confidence between it and Wisniewski, the fraudulent concealment statute did not relieve Wisniewski of the obligation to investigate the Diocese’s wrongdoing. See Dancor International, Ltd. v. Friedman, Goldberg &amp; Mintz, 288 Ill. App. 3d 666, 676, 681 N.E.2d 617, 624 (1997) (the fraudulent concealment statute does not apply to a party who, through the exercise of ordinary diligence, could have discovered the concealed information). The Diocese notes that Wisniewski always remembered that the sexual abuse occurred, knew the identity of his abuser, and knew that his abuser was a priest of the Diocese. The Diocese concludes, therefore, that as a matter of law Wisniewski always had sufficient notice of his cause of action against it regardless of any fraudulent concealment by silence. We disagree.\n“Whether the injured person has become possessed of sufficient information concerning his or her injury and its cause to put a reasonable person on inquiry to determine whether actionable conduct is involved is usually a question of fact.” Pruitt v. Schultz, 235 Ill. App. 3d 934, 936, 601 N.E.2d 1372, 1374 (1992). In the present case, the jury found, based upon the evidence presented at the trial, that Wisniewski commenced his action within five years of the time he knew or should have known (1) that he sustained an injury and (2) that the injury was caused by the wrongful conduct of the Diocese. The factual issue of when Wisniewski is deemed to have discovered his injury was properly submitted to the jury, and for the reasons explained above, we believe that the evidence supports the jury’s finding in Wisniewski’s favor on that issue. We cannot say that only one conclusion could be drawn on undisputed facts; therefore, the question was “best left for [the jury].” Pruitt, 235 Ill. App. 3d at 936-37, 601 N.E.2d at 1375.\nIn support of its argument that Wisniewski had sufficient notice to prevent the application of the fraudulent concealment statute, the Diocese cites a number of cases from other jurisdictions, including Doe v. Archdiocese of Cincinnati, 2006 — Ohio—2625, 849 N.E.2d 268, Baselice v. Franciscan Friars Assumption BVM Province, Inc., 2005 PA Super 246, 879 A.2d 270, and Cevenini v. Archbishop of Washington, 707 A.2d 768 (D.C. 1998).\nIn Archdiocese of Cincinnati, the plaintiff was a victim of child sexual abuse by a priest that occurred from 1980 through 1983. Archdiocese of Cincinnati, 2006 — Ohio—2625, at ¶3, 849 N.E.2d at 270-71. The plaintiff filed a lawsuit against the archdiocese in 2004 after he learned that the priest had abused other victims. Id. at ¶5, 849 N.E.2d at 271. The plaintiff alleged that before he learned about the other victims, he had no reason to believe that the archdiocese had known about the priest’s abuse. Id. at ¶4, 849 N.E.2d at 271. The court, however, noted that the plaintiff “knew the identity of his alleged perpetrator and knew the employer of his alleged perpetrator.” Id. at ¶47, 849 N.E.2d at 279. Therefore, in holding that the plaintiffs claim was time-barred as a matter of law, the court stated that the plaintiff “had all of the facts necessary to investigate and prosecute his potential causes of action against the archdiocese.” Id. at ¶47, 849 N.E.2d at 279.\nSimilarly, in Baselice, the court noted that the plaintiff “knew he was injured, knew the identity of the primary cause of his injury, and knew his abuser was an employee of the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, yet [the plaintiff] conducted no investigation into any *** aspect of the matter.” Baselice, 2005 PA Super 246, ¶19, 879 A.2d 270. The court concluded that, as a matter of law, “[t]hese facts alone were sufficient to put [the plaintiff] on notice that there was a possibility that the Archdiocese had been negligent.” Baselice, 2005 PA Super 246, ¶19, 879 A.2d 270.\nIn Cevenini, the plaintiffs were sexually abused by a priest when they were teenagers in the mid-1970s. Cevenini, 707 A.2d at 770. The plaintiffs filed a complaint against the archdiocese in 1995 after a newspaper published a series of articles disclosing that the archdiocese knew of the priest’s pedophilic tendencies before he was assigned to the plaintiffs’ church. Cevenini, 707 A.2d at 770. The plaintiffs maintained that they had no knowledge of the archdiocese’s wrongdoing until the publication of the newspaper articles. Cevenini, 707 A.2d at 770. In holding that the claims were untimely as a matter of law, the Cevenini court stated the plaintiffs were aware that it was the archdiocese that assigned the priest to their church and that the priest was a “subordinate representative” of the archdiocese. Cevenini, 707 A.2d at 773. In addition, the abuse occurred on church premises while the priest was functioning as a representative of the archdiocese. The court concluded that under these circumstances, “a reasonable plaintiff would have investigated his potential claims against the Archdiocese at the same time that his claims accrued against its representative.” Cevenini, 707 A.2d at 773.\nIn the recent case of Doe v. Catholic Bishop for the Diocese of Memphis, 306 S.W.3d 712 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2008), the court analyzed similar cases from different jurisdictions, including Archdiocese of Cincinnati and Cevenini, and concluded that there were two views on this issue. The court cited Archdiocese of Cincinnati and Cevenini as examples of an “apparent majority” of courts that hold “as a matter of law that the plaintiff, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, would have discovered the defendant church’s knowledge of the clergy member’s prior acts of abuse, and that the plaintiffs lawsuit against the church is time-barred.” Catholic Bishop for the Diocese of Memphis, 306 S.W.3d at 722. The court also stated that a “minority of courts” have held that “a fact issue exists as to whether the plaintiff, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, would have discovered the church’s alleged knowledge of the prior sexual abuse.” Catholic Bishop for the Diocese of Memphis, 306 S.W3d at 722.\nAs an example of the “minority” cases, the Catholic Bishop for the Diocese of Memphis court cited A.L.M. v. Diocese of Allentown, 68 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th 111 (2004), and Matthews v. Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th 393 (2004). In A.L.M., the plaintiffs alleged that they were sexually abused by priests when they were minors between 1965 and 1982. A.L.M., 68 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 114-15. In 2004, they filed suit against the diocese and the bishop but not against the offending priests. A.L.M., 68 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 114-15. The plaintiffs maintained that they were unable to discover that the diocese was a cause of their injuries until 2002 when representatives of the diocese disclosed that they had knowledge of prior incidents of child sexual abuse by the clergy members. A.L.M., 68 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 117. The plaintiffs’ claims were not based on the vicarious liability of an employer. A.L.M., 68 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 124.\nThe A.L.M. court held that there was a factual issue concerning when the plaintiffs knew or should have known that the defendants were a cause of their harm. A.L.M., 68 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 124. The court stated, “Although the plaintiffs knew of their injuries and of the priests who abused them many years ago, if the plaintiffs’ allegations are correct, a question remains as to when the plaintiffs knew or had reason to know that the defendants were also a cause of their harm.” A.L.M., 68 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 124. “Based on the allegations in the complaints, this did not occur until 2002, when disclosures by church officials alerted the plaintiffs to a conspiracy within the church to conceal sexual abuse against minors.” A.L.M., 68 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 125.\nSimilarly, in Matthews, the plaintiff alleged that he was sexually abused by a priest in 1989 when he was 12 years old. Matthews, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 395. In 2004, he brought a lawsuit against his diocese after learning that the diocese had a policy of shielding and protecting priests engaged in child sexual abuse. Matthews, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 395. He alleged that prior to that time, he had no reason to suspect that the diocese would have permitted the priest to continue to minister once the diocese discovered that the priest had a history of sexually molesting children. Matthews, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 395. The court noted that the plaintiffs claims were not based on a theory of respondeat superior. Matthews, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 395. Instead, the claims were based on allegations that, after the diocese had notice of complaints concerning the priest molesting other children, it allowed the priest to continue to serve at the plaintiffs church, ministering to minor parishioners. Matthews, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 395-96.\nThe Matthews court held that a jury should decide the issue of when the plaintiff knew or should have known of his cause of action. Matthews, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 407. The court rejected CeveninVs holding that, as a matter of a law, at the time of the abuse, a plaintiff should have reason to suspect that the diocese may also have independent responsibility for the abuse. The court did not find CeveninVs rationale to be persuasive because “the employer is a church which the plaintiff attends and the employee is engaging in activity that may be reasonably viewed as conduct that the church could never tolerate.” Matthews, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 407. The Matthews court stated, “A jury may find that there is a loud ring of truth to plaintiffs statement that he and his family never approached Diocesan officials to ask whether they had knowingly assigned to their church, to work directly with the parishioners, including young boys, a priest with a history of sexually molesting children, because it would never cross their minds that the church would do so.” Matthews, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 407. The court emphasized that reasonable minds could differ and that the jury was not required to find that the plaintiff and his family should have considered the possibility that the diocese knowingly assigned a pedophile as their church’s priest. Matthews, 67 Pa. D. &amp; C. 4th at 407.\nWe find the reasoning in A.L.M. and Matthews to be persuasive under the facts of the present case. Similar to the facts in A.L.M. and Matthews, Wisniewski’s claims against the Diocese were not based on respondeat superior but were based on the allegations that the Diocese knowingly installed a pedophile priest at the Salem parish. In addition, similar to A.L.M. and Matthews, the jury in the present case was entitled to find that Wisniewski had no reason to suspect that the Diocese intentionally assigned to the Salem parish a priest with a history of child sexual abuse.\nAs noted above, in Chicago Park District, the Illinois Supreme Court held that the City of Chicago had no reason to suspect that its fiduciary, a city alderman, “had entered into a scheme of bribery and fraud with the defendants” and that “[t]o hold that the City was obliged to search for misfeasance of its duly elected public official, absent a prior indication of wrongdoing, would require it to presume unfaithfulness on the part of its fiduciary.” Chicago Park District, 78 Ill. 2d at 562-63, 402 N.E.2d at 185. Likewise, in the present case, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that Wisniewski was under no obligation to search for wrongdoing by the Diocese when Kownacki was engaged in activities that may be reasonably viewed as conduct that the Diocese would never tolerate. The jury was entitled to find that Wisniewski was not required to presume such unfaithfulness on the part of the Diocese. Therefore, the trial court properly submitted the question of when Wisniewski is deemed to have discovered his claim to the jury as a factual issue, rather than deciding the issue in the Diocese’s favor as a matter of law. See also Turner v. Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington, Vermont, 2009 VT 101, ¶56, 987 A.2d 960 (the issue of whether the plaintiff was on inquiry notice of the diocese’s potential liability of church leadership was an issue for the jury).\nFurthermore, as noted above, there are two prongs of the factual analysis for when Wisniewski is deemed to have discovered his claim. With respect to the first prong of the definition instruction concerning when Wisniewski is deemed to have discovered his cause of action, the only evidence presented to tjhe jury in the present case concerning when Wisniewski knew or shquld have known that he sustained an injury came from Dr. Peterson. The trial court in the present case would have erred if it had taken this factual decision away from the jury and decided the issue as a. matter of law by granting the Diocese’s motion for a judgment n.o.v:\nThe Diocese also cites Clay v. Kuhl, 189 Ill. 2d 603, 727 N.E.2d 217 (2000), and Parks v. Kownacki, 193 Ill. 2d 164, 737 N.E.2d 287 (2000), in support of its argument. We believe that Clay and Parks are distinguishable from the present case.\nIn Clay, the plaintiff was born in 1964, and she alleged that a clergyman began sexually abusing her in 1972 or 1973 and continued abusing her for seven years. Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 605, 727 N.E.2d at 219. In January of 1996, the plaintiff filed a complaint against the clergyman and the religious order that had hired him. Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 605, 727 N.E.2d at 219. Similar to the present case, the plaintiff in Clay alleged that the religious order had notice of similar misconduct committed by the clergyman but failed to take any steps to prevent the abuse she endured. Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 605, 727 N.E.2d at 219. The supreme court held that, as a matter of law, the plaintiffs allegations were untimely. Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 610, 727 N.E.2d at 221.\nIn Clay, the plaintiffs complaint alleged that the plaintiffs life was on a “tragic course” and that she did not realize that it was based, at least in part, on the abuse. Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 609, 727 N.E.2d at 221. In ruling that the plaintiffs action was untimely as a matter of law, the court noted that the “plaintiff had sufficient information about her injury and its cause to require her to bring suit long before the date of discovery alleged in the complaint.” Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 610, 727 N.E.2d at 221. The court held that the plaintiffs alleged failure to fully discover the nature of her injuries was insufficient to delay the running of the limitations period. Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 610, 727 N.E.2d at 222.\nThe Clay court distinguished the plaintiffs claim from tort actions arising from exposure to asbestos. Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 612, 727 N.E.2d at 222. The court stated that there were “substantial distinctions between cases involving exposure to asbestos or other dangerous substances, in which the risk of harm is not immediately apparent, and cases involving events that give rise to an immediate awareness of injury.” Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 612, 727 N.E.2d at 222. The court concluded that in asbestos cases, “ ‘the plaintiffs did not discover that they suffered any injury until long after the tortious conduct occurred.’ ” (Emphasis in original.) Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 612, 727 N.E.2d at 222 (quoting Golla v. General Motors Corp., 167 Ill. 2d 353, 367, 657 N.E.2d 894, 901 (1995)).\nThe facts of the present case are distinguishable from Clay because, in Clay, the plaintiff alleged that she suffered from subsequent psychological problems as a result of the abuse but merely failed to realize a causal connection between the problems and the abuse. Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 609-10, 727 N.E.2d at 221. In the present case, Wisniewski did not suffer any psychological problems until 2002. His life was not on a “tragic course” as was alleged in the complaint in Clay. Accordingly, the facts of the present case are more analogous to those cases noted by the Clay court in which the plaintiffs did not discover any injury until long after the tortious conduct occurred. The facts of the present case were certainly close enough for reasonable minds to differ. Furthermore, the Clay decision does not analyze any facts in that case relevant to the second prong of the determination of when a plaintiff is deemed to have discovered his claim. Under the second prong, for the reasons discussed above, there was sufficient evidence presented in the present case for the jury to determine the factual issue of when Wisniewski knew or should have known that the Diocese’s wrongful conduct caused his injuries.\nAccordingly, we find Clay to be distinguishable. A court of review “should not usurp the function of the jury and substitute its judgment on questions of fact fairly submitted, tried, and determined from the evidence which did not greatly preponderate either way.” Maple v. Gustafson, 151 Ill. 2d 445, 452-53, 603 N.E.2d 508, 512 (1992). We cannot “reweigh the evidence and set aside a verdict merely because the jury could have drawn different inferences or conclusions, or because the court feels that other results are more reasonable.” Maple, 151 Ill. 2d at 452, 603 N.E.2d at 512.\nLikewise, Parks is distinguishable from the present case. In Parks, the plaintiff was the 14-year-old girl we described in the background section above, Gina, who was abused by Kownacki when he was the priest in St. Francisville and in Washington Park in the early 1970s. In 1995, Gina filed a lawsuit against Kownacki and the Diocese, and the defendants raised the statute of limitations and the statute of repose as a defense to Gina’s claim. Parks, 193 Ill. 2d at 167, 737 N.E.2d at 289-90. The trial court dismissed Gina’s complaint as untimely under both the statute of limitations and the statute of repose. Parks, 193 Ill. 2d at 167, 737 N.E.2d at 289-90.\nIn determining when the plaintiff knew or reasonably should have known that she sustained an injury, the Parks court noted as follows: “While she alleges that she did not know that the sexual relationship was wrong, it is clear from her actions — telling her parents, reporting Kownacki to [the bishop] — that she knew that Kownacki had wronged her.” Parks, 193 Ill. 2d at 177, 737 N.E.2d at 294-95. The court stated, “Although plaintiff was not aware of her post[ ]traumatic stress disorder until recently, one particular injury that plaintiff claims, the forced abortion, obviously was apparent when plaintiff went to the hospital and was given dilation and curettage.” Parks, 193 Ill. 2d at 177-78, 737 N.E.2d at 295.\nIn the present case, however, the only evidence presented at the trial concerning when Wisniewski discovered his injuries came from Dr. Peterson, who testified that Wisniewski did not begin suffering posttraumatic stress disorder until 2002. Unlike Parks, in the present case, there was no evidence that Wisniewski suffered from any physical injuries as a result of the abuse.\nWe do not believe that the Clay or Parks decision allows us to set aside the jury’s finding of fraudulent concealment in the present case. Under the facts presented at the trial, viewed in the light most favorable to Wisniewski, the jury could have concluded that the Diocese, through its officers, fraudulently concealed Wisniewski’s claim against it by its silence, as defined under the second prong of the fraudulent concealment definition instruction. The jury was entitled to find that Wisniewski timely brought his cause of action against the Diocese within five years after discovering his cause of action in 2002. See 735 ILCS 5/13 — 215 (West 2008). We cannot conclude that “all of the evidence, when viewed in its aspect most favorable to [Wisniewski], so overwhelmingly favors [the Diocese] that no contrary verdict based on that evidence could ever stand” (Pedrick v. Peoria &amp; Eastern R.R. Co., 37 Ill. 2d 494, 510, 229 N.E.2d 504, 513-14 (1967)). Accordingly, we must affirm the circuit court’s denial of the Diocese’s motion for a judgment n.o.v. on the issue of the Diocese’s fraudulent concealment and the timeliness of Wisniewski’s claim under the statute of repose.\n2.\nCircuit Court’s Finding of Equitable Estoppel and Equitable Tolling\nWhen the circuit court denied the Diocese’s motion for a summary judgment, it ruled that it would separately determine the factual issues relevant to the application of equitable estoppel and equitable tolling. See Vaughn v. Speaker, 126 Ill. 2d 150, 167, 533 N.E.2d 885, 892 (1988) (“the estoppel issue should be determined by a trier of fact other than the jury which may determine the merits of the negligence action” and “may be determined by the circuit court”). While the jury deliberated on the issues of fraudulent concealment, liability, and damages, the circuit court, “after considering all the testimony and evidence” and “assessing the credibility of witnesses,” entered an order finding that Wisniewski’s complaint was “not barred by the statute of limitations or statute of repose based on equitable estoppel and equitable tolling having been established by clear and convincing evidence.” The circuit court found that Wisniewski proved equitable estoppel and equitable tolling by clear and convincing evidence. On appeal, the Diocese takes issue with these findings.\nHowever, we have already determined that the jury properly decided the issue of fraudulent concealment. Equitable estoppel and equitable tolling are alternative theories for tolling the statute of repose. Therefore, we need not separately analyze the circuit court’s finding of equitable estoppel and equitable tolling.\nB.\nStatute of Limitations\nWisniewski raised the fraudulent concealment statute in response to the Diocese’s affirmative defense under the applicable statute of limitations. The jury found in Wisniewski’s favor on the issue of fraudulent concealment, and for the reasons we discussed above, we affirm the circuit court’s denial of the Diocese’s request for a judgment n.o.v. on the issue of fraudulent concealment.\nAs an alternative argument, the Diocese asserts that, under the statute of limitations and the common law discovery rule, Wisniewski’s claim expired in 1981, two years after he turned 18. See 735 ILCS 5/13 — 211 (West 2008); Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 607-08, 727 N.E.2d at 220-21. The Diocese argues, therefore, that the circuit court should have granted it a judgment n.o.v. on the statute of limitations issue. We disagree. We do not believe that the Diocese was entitled to a judgment in its favor as a matter of law under the applicable statute of limitations and the common law discovery rule.\nIn order to analyze the Diocese’s argument that Wisniewski’s claim was untimely under the statute of limitations, we must first determine which particular statute of limitations applies to Wisniewski’s claim. We believe that the general statute of limitations applicable to personal injury claims and the common law discovery rule apply to Wisniewski’s claim.\nPrior to January 1, 1991, claims of personal injury resulting from childhood sexual abuse were governed by the general statute of limitations applicable to personal injury claims. Clay v. Kuhl, 189 Ill. 2d 603, 608, 727 N.E.2d 217, 220-21 (2000). On January 1, 1991, the legislature enacted a two-year statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse cases that incorporated the common law “discovery rule.” Benton v. Vonnahmen, 288 Ill. App. 3d 199, 206, 679 N.E.2d 1270, 1275 (1997) (section 13 — 202.2(b) “codifies [the] common law discovery rule”). Under its express terms, this statute of limitations does not begin to run until the victim “discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should discover” that the abuse occurred and that the abuse caused the personal injury. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 110, par. 13 — 202.2(b).\nOn July 24, 2003, the legislature lengthened the statute of limitations for childhood sexual abuse claims and expanded on the statute’s discovery rule language. After the 2003 amendment, section 13— 202.2(b) of the Code provided that actions for damages for personal injury based on childhood sexual abuse must be commenced within 10 years of the abused person’s eighteenth birthday or “within 5 years of the date the person abused discovers or through the use of reasonable diligence should discover both (i) that the act of childhood sexual abuse occurred and (ii) that the injury was caused by the childhood sexual abuse.” 735 ILCS 5/13 — 202.2(b) (West 2008). Section 13 — 202.2(b) further states, “Knowledge of the abuse does not constitute discovery of the injury or the causal relationship between any later-discovered injury and the abuse.” 735 ILCS 5/13 — 202.2(b) (West 2008).\nIn the present case, however, if the statute of limitations expired on Wisniewski’s cause of action under the common law discovery rule, it did so in 1981, prior to the enactment of section 13 — 202.2(b) of the Code. Accordingly, in analyzing the timeliness of Wisniewski’s claims under the relevant statute of limitations, we will apply the general statute of limitations applicable to personal injury claims and the common law discovery rule. See Diocese of Dallas, 234 Ill. 2d at 409, 917 N.E.2d at 484.\nThe supreme court has construed the common law discovery rule to activate the running of the statute of limitations when a person knows or reasonably should know of his injury and also knows or reasonably should know that it was wrongfully caused. Golla, 167 Ill. 2d at 360-61, 657 N.E.2d at 898. The question of when the discovery rule activates the running of the statute of limitations is ordinarily a question of fact. County of Du Page v. Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White, Inc., 109 Ill. 2d 143, 153-54, 485 N.E.2d 1076, 1080 (1985).\nThe statute of limitations and common law discovery issues are presented to us in the present case by way of the denial of a motion for a judgment n.o.v. As we noted above, in order to be entitled to a judgment n.o.v., the movant has to establish that “all of the evidence, when viewed in its aspect most favorable to the opponent, so overwhelmingly favors movant that no contrary verdict based on that evidence could ever stand.” Pedrick v. Peoria &amp; Eastern R.R. Co., 37 Ill. 2d 494, 510, 229 N.E.2d 504, 513-14 (1967). In the present case, the evidence was not so overwhelmingly in favor of the Diocese on the factual issues involving the statute of limitations and common law discovery rule that the jury’s verdict cannot stand. Accordingly, we must affirm the circuit court’s denial of the motion for a judgment n.o.v. on those factual issues.\nIn the present case, as noted above, the jury was asked to decide first whether Wisniewski brought his claim within five years of discovering his claim before it could consider the Diocese’s liability and damages. The jury instructions further stated that Wisniewski is deemed to have discovered his claim when he knew or should have known that he sustained an injury and knew or should have known that his injury was caused by wrongful conduct by the Diocese. This definition instruction was identical to the definition of the common law discovery rule. See Golla, 167 Ill. 2d at 360-61, 657 N.E.2d at 898 (the effect of the common law discovery rule is to “postpone the commencement of the relevant statute of limitations until the injured plaintiff knows or reasonably should know that he has been injured and that his injury was wrongfully caused”). The jury found that Wisniewski brought his claim within five years of discovering his claim as defined in the jury instructions. Wisniewski filed his claim against the Diocese in October 2002, and the only evidence Wisniewski presented concerning when he first learned of his injuries and of the Diocese’s wrongful conduct was that he discovered them in 2002. Accordingly, by ruling in his favor on the issue of fraudulent concealment, the jury must have found that Wisniewski filed his claim the same year he discovered his cause of action.\nIn support of its argument that it was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law under the statute of limitations, the Diocese cites Parks and Clay. For the reasons noted above, however, those cases are distinguishable from the facts of the present case. Unlike Parks and Clay, the only evidence presented to the jury in the present case was that Wisniewski was not aware of any injury as a result of the Diocese’s wrongful conduct until 2002, the year he filed his claim. This evidence presented a question of fact for the jury to decide concerning the application of the common law discovery rule. Therefore, we must affirm the circuit court’s denial of the Diocese’s motion for a judgment n.o.v. on the statute of limitations issue.\nII.\nLegal Sufficiency of the Claims\nThe Diocese also argues that the circuit court should have granted its motion for a judgment n.o.v. because Wisniewski’s claims against the Diocese were legally insufficient. The Diocese argues that it did not owe any duty to Wisniewski and, therefore, cannot be found to have breached any such duty. We disagree. The Diocese’s argument that it did not owe any duty to Wisniewski is based on the following incorrect assertion in its brief: “Illinois courts have found that there is no duty or special relationship between a parishioner and his or her pastor, church, or church administration.”\nAs noted above, courts have held that Illinois does not recognize a cause of action for “clergy malpractice” because those actions typically require the courts to interpret religious tenets and that analysis would violate the free exercise clause of the first amendment. However, Illinois allows judicial scrutiny of the actions of clergy that “[do] not implicate judicial assessment of the tenets of a particular religion or a determination of whether a particular litigant has adhered to those tenets.” Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1433 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Under those circumstances, the sole inquiry is whether the individual has engaged in conduct that the state has deemed harmful. Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1433 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). In other words, “[t]ort claims for behavior by a cleric that does not require the examination of religious doctrine are cognizable.” Dausch, 52 F.3d at 1433 (Ripple, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).\nIn the present case, the Diocese’s assertion that it owed no duty to its Salem parishioners, including Wisniewski, under the facts of this case is entirely false. Wisniewski alleged and proved that the Diocese installed Kownacki as the priest of the parish in Salem at a time when it knew that Kownacki was a pedophile and had violently abused other minors at other parishes. The agents of the Diocese not only kept quiet about Kownacki’s violent pedophile tendencies, but they expressly misrepresented to the Salem parishioners that Kownacki was suitable to minister to and have unsupervised contact with the children of the parish. The CEO of the Diocese, the bishop, directed the unknowing Salem parishioners to put their full faith and trust in Kownacki’s piety, prudence, and character. It is without question that the State of Illinois deems such conduct as harmful, and neither the circuit court nor the jury was required to interpret Catholic religious doctrine to reach that conclusion. The first amendment simply does not shield the Diocese from liability for knowingly installing a child sexual abuser as a parish priest under the facts of this case.\nIn Kigin v. Woodmen of the World Insurance Co., 185 Ill. App. 3d 400, 541 N.E.2d 735 (1989), a camp counselor sexually abused a 15-year-old camper at a youth camp. The camper filed suit against the camp operator who had employed the counselor and knew that the counselor had been intoxicated and had provided alcohol to the plaintiff. In analyzing the sufficiency of the plaintiffs complaint, the court stated that to allow the counselor, a 41-year-old man, “ ‘to be isolated with a 15-year-old girl at a remote location outside the presence of other sober adults’ ” “was a formula for disaster.” Kigin, 185 Ill. App. 3d at 403, 541 N.E.2d at 737. The court held that the complaint sufficiently alleged that the camp operator knew or should have known of the need to exercise control over the counselor. Kigin, 185 Ill. App. 3d at 403, 541 N.E.2d at 737. The court stated that when the camp operator learned that the counselor had become intoxicated, plied the minor with alcohol, and had gone off alone into the woods with the minor at night, the camp operator then had a duty to take steps to protect the plaintiff. Kigin, 185 Ill. App. 3d at 403-04, 541 N.E.2d at 737.\nLikewise, in the present case, the Diocese had knowledge of Kownacki’s propensity to abuse minor children, plying them with alcohol prior to abusing them and telling them the abuse was a good thing. The Diocese placed Kownacki in the position to abuse Wisniewski in the same manner, and the Diocese facilitated and promoted Kownacki’s abuse not only through silence but through affirmative acts of misrepresentation concerning Kownacki’s character. Almost all the abuse Wisniewski described to the jury occurred on church property that Kownacki occupied solely because of his position as a priest of the Diocese. The opportunity for abuse created by the Diocese called for the exercise of control by the Diocese. Its failure to do so is unquestionably actionable in Illinois courts.\nIII.\nRule 215 Motion for Mental Examination\nThe Diocese argues that the trial court abused its discretion in denying its request to perform a mental examination of Wisniewski pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rule 215 (eff. July 1, 2002). The Diocese disclosed Dr. Moisy Shopper as its expert on June 16, 2008, and on June 24, 2008, it filed a motion for a mental examination of Wisniewski to be completed by Dr. Shopper. On July 3, 2008, the circuit court denied the Diocese’s motion for a mental examination because the motion was “extremely untimely” and because the Diocese did not provide the court with requested information in a timely fashion.\nRule 215(a) provides in part as follows:\n“In any action in which the physical or mental condition of a party *** is in controversy, the court, upon notice and on motion made within a reasonable time before the trial, may order such party to submit to a physical or mental examination by a licensed professional in a discipline related to the physical or mental condition which is involved.” Ill. S. Ct. R. 215(a) (eff. July 1, 2002).\n“The purpose of the rule permitting the court to order a party to submit to physical or mental examination by a physician suggested by the party requesting examination is not to provide an expert witness for the litigant but to permit discovery.” Carlisle v. Harp, 200 Ill. App. 3d 908, 913-14, 558 N.E.2d 318, 321 (1990). The circuit court has broad discretion in determining what is “a reasonable time before trial.” Carlisle, 200 Ill. App. 3d at 913, 558 N.E.2d at 321. In the present case, we do not believe that the circuit court abused its discretion in ruling that the Diocese did not file its motion within a reasonable time before the trial.\nWisniewski filed his complaint on October 24, 2002, and from the very beginning, he alleged that he suffered “severe and permanent injuries or diseases to his psychological and psychiatric health.” In February of 2008, the jury trial was scheduled to begin in August of 2008. The Diocese did not file the motion requesting a Rule 215 mental examination until June 24, 2008.\nThe circuit court conducted a hearing on the Diocese’s motion on June 25, 2008. At the hearing, the circuit court noted that the motion was filed 50 days from the trial date, and the court indicated that it did not intend to continue the trial date because of the motion. At the hearing, the court gave the Diocese until June 27, 2008, to provide the court with information concerning how long its expert needed to conduct the examination, when the examination would take place, when the expert would be able to give his written report, and when he would be available for a deposition. The Diocese, however, did not provide the trial court with any information until June 30, 2008, when the circuit court received a proposed outline of the mental examination, which was prepared by Dr. Shopper and which indicated that he wanted to conduct three two-hour sessions with Wisniewski in order to conduct his examination. The Diocese did not provide the other information the circuit court requested, including when the expert was available to conduct his examination, when he would have his report prepared, and when he would be available for a deposition.\nOn July 3, 2008, the circuit court denied the Diocese’s motion for the mental examination. The court noted that there were only 46 days before the beginning of the jury trial and that the Diocese had not furnished the ordered information. On July 15, 2008, the Diocese filed a motion to reconsider the denial of its request for a mental examination. The trial court held a hearing on the motion to reconsider on July 21, 2008, four weeks prior to the trial, and denied the Diocese’s motion to reconsider. The court stated at the hearing that the Diocese still had not furnished the information the court had requested. The court stated, “You can’t expect a trial judge, forty[-]some days before trial, to grant [a mental examination] unless the trial judge knows *** when would the exam go forward, when would the written report be completed, and when would *** [the expert] be available for [the deposition].” The court noted that the jury trial was scheduled to begin in four weeks and that it could not grant the Diocese’s motion without having the information it requested.\nIn Ford v. Herman, 316 Ill. App. 3d 726, 736, 737 N.E.2d 332, 341 (2000), the court affirmed a circuit court’s denial of a Rule 215 motion for a medical examination when the motion was filed 68 days before the scheduled trial date. The court stated: “No dates were proposed for examinations and subsequent depositions. So the trial court could not know when those events would be completed.” Ford, 316 Ill. App. 3d at 736, 737 N.E.2d at 341. In the present case, for whatever reason, the Diocese chose not to provide the circuit court with the information it requested concerning when key events relevant to the examination would be completed. Under these circumstances, we will not find that the circuit court abused its discretion.\nIV\nEvidentiary Rulings\nThe Diocese’s final argument is that the circuit court abused its discretion in striking certain references from Kopacz’s notes dated August 30, 2002, that he created after a therapy session with Wisniewski. In addition, the Diocese argues that the circuit court abused its discretion in limiting its cross-examination of two of Wisniewski’s witnesses concerning the August 30, 2002, notes.\nThe admission of evidence and the scope of cross-examination are issues within the sound discretion of a trial court, and a reviewing court will not reverse rulings on those issues absent an abuse of discretion. Snelson v. Kamm, 204 Ill. 2d 1, 33, 787 N.E.2d 796, 814 (2003); Leonardi v. Loyola University of Chicago, 168 Ill. 2d 83, 102, 658 N.E.2d 450, 459 (1995). In addition, an error in evidentiary rulings does not warrant a reversal unless the error was substantially prejudicial and affected the outcome of the trial. Simmons v. Garces, 198 Ill. 2d 541, 566-67, 763 N.E.2d 720, 736 (2002).\nIn the present case, on August 30, 2002, prior to Wisniewski filing his lawsuit in the present case, Kopacz had a therapy session with Wisniewski and prepared some notes concerning the therapy session. The notes referenced Wisniewski talking to Kopacz about his case against the Diocese. Wisniewski told Kopacz that his lawyer had sent a letter to the Diocese requesting a response, and he told Kopacz that he was not sure whether a court case would be viable.\nAt the trial, the Diocese attempted to first introduce this evidence during its cross-examination of Wisniewski’s expert witness, Dr. Peterson. Peterson testified that a part of his investigation included reviewing Kopacz’s notes. During its cross-examination of Peterson, the Diocese asked Peterson the following: “In the August 30th, ‘02 notes of Dr. Kopacz, Dr. Kopacz’s notes, quote, Not sure whether a court case would be viable or not, close quote, correct?” Wisniewski’s attorney objected to this questioning, stating that it related to settlement negotiations that occurred in August of 2002. The circuit court sustained Wisniewski’s objection but stated: “Clearly, you can’t bring it up in front of a jury. I’ll allow you to make an offer of proof outside the presence of the jury. But for right now, we’re going to have to skip over it.” The Diocese argued to the circuit court that the questioning did not involve settlement negotiations, and the court responded, “We’ll go over it outside the presence of the jury, and after I hear what I hear, I’ll let you know how I rule, but for right now, let’s skip over it and go on.” Later, during cross-examination of Peterson, the Diocese again asked Peterson about Kopacz’s August 30, 2002, notes, asking whether the notes indicated that Wisniewski was not sure whether a court case would be viable. The court again sustained Wisniewski’s objection to this testimony, stating that it had already directed the parties not to address this aspect of the notes because it referenced settlement discussions.\nWisniewski introduced Kopacz’s testimony by way of an evidence deposition. Prior to the presentation of the deposition testimony, the circuit court struck a portion of the cross-examination of Kopacz that referred to the communication Wisniewski had with Kopacz on August 30, 2002, about the viability of the lawsuit. In striking the testimony, the court stated that the questioning improperly referred to settlement negotiations and that the questioning also involved an irrelevant legal opinion on the statute of limitations issue.\nOn appeal, the Diocese argues that the circuit court abused its discretion in preventing it from introducing evidence that on August 30, 2002, Wisniewski expressed concern during therapy with Kopacz about the viability of a lawsuit. We agree with the circuit court that Wisniewski’s expression of concern about the viability of his case against the Diocese was irrelevant and immaterial to the issues before the jury. Evidence is relevant if it has “ ‘any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.’ ” DiCosola v. Bowman, 342 Ill. App. 3d 530, 535, 794 N.E.2d 875, 879 (2003) (quoting Wojcik v. City of Chicago, 299 Ill. App. 3d 964, 971, 702 N.E.2d 303, 309 (1998)). The fact that a person untrained in the practice of law expresses concern over the viability of his or her legal claim is hardly remarkable and is of no consequence to any issue of material fact. Furthermore, the Diocese has not made a convincing case that the jury’s verdict would have been different had this testimony been admitted. Accordingly, the judgment of the circuit court is affirmed.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court of St. Clair County.\nAffirmed.\nT&#39;he record on appeal does not explain what type of facility the Hincke House is but indicates that the Diocese temporarily housed Kownacki at the Hincke House for treatment.\nIn 2002, the Bishops of the United States adopted a nationwide policy for dealing with child sexual abuse and misconduct by priests, and that policy was adopted by the Diocese in July of 2003. This new policy replaced the 1993 policy.\nJudge Ripple wrote separately, concurring in part and dissenting in part, but the concurring portions of his opinion are the majority holdings on the issues addressed therein.\nSection 13 — 202.2(b) was amended on January 1, 2011, to change 5 years to 20 years. Pub. Act 96 — 1093, §5, eff. Jan. 1, 2011.&quot;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}, {&#39;author&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE SPOMER,&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE SPOMER,\ndissenting:\nI respectfully dissent. In so doing, I recognize that the equities in this case overwhelmingly favor the plaintiff and that the defendant’s conduct was egregious and contributed to the harm that the plaintiff has suffered. However, my review of Illinois law as it applies to the facts of this case compels a conclusion that the plaintiffs claims were time-barred in 1991 when the plaintiff reached the age of 30. At that time, the statute of repose applicable to childhood sexual abuse cases was “12 years after the date on which the person abused attains the age of 18 years.” Ill. Rev. Stat. 1991, ch. 110, par. 13 — 202.2(b). As the Illinois Supreme Court has made clear, this statute of repose applies to claims arising from alleged misconduct of the Diocese to the same extent that it applies to the claims against the priest who perpetrated the abuse. Doe A. v. Diocese of Dallas, 234 Ill. 2d 393, 412-13 (2009). In addition, the due process clause of the Illinois Constitution prohibits claims that were once time-barred from being revived through the subsequent legislative action of the Illinois General Assembly that has since repealed the statute of repose. Doe A., 234 Ill. 2d at 411-12.\nRealizing this and in an attempt to toll the statute of repose, the plaintiff has raised the doctrines of fraudulent concealment, equitable tolling, and equitable estoppel. All three of these defenses to the statute of repose require that acts on the part of the defendant, or omissions, in the case of fraudulent concealment where a fiduciary or special relationship is shown, prevent the plaintiff from discovering his cause of action. See Clay v. Kuhl, 189 Ill. 2d 603, 613-14 (2000) (reciting the elements of fraudulent concealment and equitable tolling); see also Orlak v. Loyola University Health System, 228 Ill. 2d 1, 22 (2007) (equitable estoppel requires that the defendant’s conduct or representations cause the plaintiff to delay filing suit). Whether or not the plaintiff can be said to have had a special relationship with the Diocese, I believe that Illinois law in effect at the time that the statute of repose expired prohibited a finding that acts or omissions by the Diocese prevented the plaintiff from discovering his claim. As further discussed below, Illinois law presumed an injury at the time the sexual abuse occurred, and, under Illinois law, the plaintiff had sufficient knowledge to investigate and prosecute potential claims against the defendant prior to the expiration of the statute of repose in 1991.\nFirst, prior to the Illinois General Assembly’s recent amendment to the statute of limitations, which provides that “[k]nowledge of the [childhood sexual] abuse does not constitute discovery of the injury or the causal relationship between any later-discovered injury and the abuse” (735 ILCS 5/13 — 202.2(b) (West 2008)), the law in Illinois was quite the opposite. As recognized by the Illinois Supreme Court in Clay, prior to the aforementioned enactment, Illinois law presumed “an intent to harm and a resulting injury” from sexual abuse. (Emphasis added.) Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 611. As in Clay, the plaintiff in the case at bar testified that he did not repress his memories of the sexual abuse. Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 613. He always remembered that he was abused, that the abuse was harmful, that Kownacki was his abuser, and that Kownacki was a representative of the Diocese. Because Illinois law presumed some injury from childhood sexual abuse at the time of the occurrence, the misconduct of the Diocese in concealing its knowledge of Kownacki’s abuse of other children, before, after, and including the plaintiff, could not have prevented the plaintiff from discovering that he was injured. The plaintiff might not have known the extent of his injuries at that time, but Illinois law presumed immediate injury from the act of the sexual abuse itself, and the plaintiff does not deny knowledge of the abuse. See Clay, 189 Ill. 2d at 613.\nSecond, although the plaintiff might not have had actual knowledge regarding the role the Diocese played in knowingly allowing Kownacki to be involved with children in the various parishes, he knew that Kownacki was a representative of the Diocese. Thus, he had sufficient knowledge of the possibility of negligence on the part of the Diocese to at least investigate its role. However, the plaintiff, at no time prior to 1991, undertook to investigate the role of the Diocese in Kownacki’s sexual abuse of him. Had the plaintiff undertaken an investigation and inquired of the Diocese, by means of discovery or otherwise, as to its role, he might have uncovered the facts that give rise to his current causes of action. Having not done so, he cannot now establish that acts or omissions on the part of the Diocese prevented him from discovering the nature of the Diocese’s misconduct prior to 1991.\nBecause the plaintiff cannot establish that the Diocese prevented him from discovering his causes of action prior to 1991, the plaintiffs causes of action were time-barred at that time under the then-applicable statute of repose and cannot be revived without running afoul of the due process clause of the Illinois Constitution. See Doe A., 234 Ill. 2d at 411-12. For these reasons, I must conclude that the circuit court erred when it denied the defendant’s motion for a summary judgment, when it denied the defendant’s motion for a directed verdict, and when it denied the defendant’s motion for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;dissent&#39;}]
[{&#39;author&#39;: &#39;PRESIDING JUSTICE GALLAGHER&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &#39;PRESIDING JUSTICE GALLAGHER\ndelivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\nJustices Lavin and Pucinski concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nOPINION\nPlaintiff-appellant, Afrouz Kheirkhahvash, filed a complaint against defendant-appellee Reza Baniassadi, alleging legal malpractice and fraud based on Baniassadi’s representation of Kheirkhahvash in immigration proceedings. Baniassadi filed a motion to dismiss pursuant to section 2—619(a)(5) of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure (Code) (735 ILCS 5/2—619(a)(5) (West 2008)) on the grounds that the complaint was time barred under section 13—214.3 of the Code (735 ILCS 5/13—214.3(b), (c) (West 2008)). The circuit court granted the motion to dismiss with prejudice and denied Baniassadi’s request for attorney fees and sanctions. On appeal, Kheirkhahvash contends that the circuit court erred in dismissing the complaint as time barred where a factual dispute exists as to when Kheirkhahvash discovered Baniassadi’s negligence, the negligence alleged was continuous and Kheirkhahvash incurred increasingly severe injuries, and a language barrier prevented the timely discovery of the injury and damages. Kheirkhahvash further contends that Baniassadi’s acts of fraudulent concealment bar him from raising a statute of limitations defense. For the following reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court.\nBACKGROUND\nKheirkhahvash was born in Iran. She came to the United States on a visitor’s visa on August 3, 1999. Her visa was set to expire in February 2000. Kheirkhahvash was fluent in Farsi and could not read, speak or write English. She retained Baniassadi, whose first language is also Farsi, in January or February of 2000. Baniassadi obtained an extension of her visitor’s visa to July 2000. Kheirkhahvash also sought Baniassadi’s advice on the issue of remaining in the United States permanently. According to Kheirkhahvash, she told him that she had come to the United States because she was afraid of her abusive husband and that she also wanted Baniassadi’s help in obtaining a divorce. Baniassadi told her that fear of her husband was not a sufficient reason for her to obtain asylum and that she should seek asylum on political grounds, based on a fear of persecution by the Iranian government. He asked about her political involvement and she told him she had never been involved in politics. He told her he would prepare a statement that he had used successfully with other clients.\nBaniassadi prepared an asylum application that contained Kheirkhahvash’s personal information. In the section of the application that asked for the information regarding the nature of the asylum claim, he included a reference to an attached exhibit. Kheirkhahvash signed the application itself (without the exhibit) on February 16, 2000. In June 2000, she signed two more documents, an attorney appearance form and another document containing biographical information.\nOn August 1, 2000, Baniassadi filed Kheirkhahvash’s asylum application. A verified personal statement was attached to the application. According to the statement, Kheirkhahvash became a supporter of Mojahedin Khaleq1 (MEK) when she was in high school. It stated that she was put on probation by her school’s Islamic committee and told that if she did not stop her anti-Islamic activities, she would be expelled from school and reported to the revolutionary guards. The statement claimed that although Kheirkhahvash passed her university entrance exam, she was put on probation for two years and ordered to support the Islamic regime, comply with Islamic dress code and attend her local mosque. When she was finally admitted to the university, she was put on probation for refusing to attend the mosque and voicing opposition to the regime. The university then reported her to the revolutionary guards. According to the statement, she and her father were both detained by the revolutionary guards and were interrogated and tortured. She married a man who allegedly was also a supporter of MEK and worked as a journalist for a magazine that was shut down by the regime. He was also interrogated and tortured by the revolutionary guards. The statement concluded by stating that Kheirkhahvash was detained and tortured a second time and upon her release, she went into hiding and was able to get out of Iran and come to the United States.\n1The record and briefs contain many spelling variations for the name of this organization, e.g., Mujahedin-e Khalq, Muhajadeen-el-Kalq, Mujahedeene-Khalq, etc.\nThe statement was signed, but Kheirkhahvash maintains that the signature on the statement is not hers and points out that it does not match other documents containing her actual signature. She also maintains that she did not see the statement until Baniassadi sent her a version of the statement that had been translated into Farsi in late August/early September, after her application had already been filed. He told her she needed to memorize the statement for her upcoming interview with immigration officials. Kheirkhahvash told him that the statement was false, she knew nothing about the MEK, her husband had never been a journalist and was not a supporter of MEK, and she could not testify to such facts. Baniassadi told her that because the application had already been filed, she had no choice but to testify to those facts or she would be denied asylum and would be deported to Iran for filing a false application.\nAt the immigration interview, Kheirkhahvash testified through a translator to the facts in the verified personal statement. At the conclusion of the interview, Baniassadi told her that her application would be approved and that she would get her green card. In fact, the asylum application was denied and she was served with a notice to appear in immigration court for a removal hearing. When she asked Baniassadi to explain the meaning of the notice, he told her that her application had been referred to an immigration judge and it would be reconsidered and granted. He again told her that his other Iranian clients had claimed persecution on account of their sympathies for the MEK and were granted asylum. He warned her that if she tried to withdraw her personal statement, the immigration judge would order that she be deported to Iran.\nKheirkhahvash said that before her removal hearing, Baniassadi told her that her father had to testify to the facts in the personal statement. When Kheirkhahvash showed the statement to her father, he became very angry with her. He refused to testify and tried to get Baniassadi to withdraw the asylum application. He said that he did not want to lie, that nobody in Iran supports the MEK, and that he did not want to get involved in anything to do with the MEK. Her father eventually agreed to testify after Baniassadi persuaded him that if he did not testify, his daughter would be deported to Iran.\nOn April 15, 2002, a hearing was held before an immigration judge and Kheirkhahvash’s father testified to the facts in the personal state ment. The government attorney introduced evidence that the MEK was listed as a terrorist organization by the Attorney General of the United States. Kheirkhahvash maintains that her father’s testimony was inconsistent, and that Baniassadi requested a continuance because he realized he needed additional evidence. He prepared an additional affidavit for her mother to sign that described in detail how Kheirkhahvash was beaten and tortured because of her support for the MEK. On April 24, 2002, Kheirkhahvash testified according to the facts in the verified personal statement. The immigration judge denied her asylum application and her withholding of removal request, finding that she was a member of a terrorist organization and that she posed a danger to the security of the United States. The judge ordered that she be deported to Iran.\nOn May 24, 2002, Baniassadi filed a motion to reconsider. The motion was denied on July 12, 2002, and Baniassadi filed an appeal with the Board of Immigration Appeals on August 12, 2002. On October 10, 2002, Kheirkhahvash was taken into custody by the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement. She was released from detention under an order of supervision dated February 4, 2003. On October 8, 2003, the Board of Immigration Appeals entered an order affirming the denial of Kheirkhahvash’s asylum application and withholding of removal on the basis of her admitted affiliation with MEK. However, the order returned the case to the immigration judge for consideration of Kheirkhahvash’s claim for protection under the Convention Against Torture.\nSometime after her release from custody, Kheirkhahvash consulted with and subsequently retained new counsel. The record contains a consent to attorney withdrawal dated November 24, 2003, withdrawing the appearance of Baniassadi as Kheirkhahvash’s attorney. It also contains a consent to substitution of counsel dated November 25, 2003, authorizing the appearance of her current attorney. Both documents are stamped as being received in court on December 3, 2003. In a letter dated November 24, 2003, and file stamped November 25, 2003, Kheirkhahvash requested the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission (ARDC) to investigate Baniassadi for advis ing her to file and testify falsely with regard to her asylum application. On July 14, 2004, Kheirkhahvash’s current attorney filed a motion to withdraw her original asylum application, contending that it was the product of ineffective assistance of counsel. On August 21, 2009, Kheirkhahvash filed a complaint against Baniassadi alleging legal malpractice and fraud. Baniassadi filed a motion to dismiss the complaint as untimely and the trial court granted the motion on December 18, 2009. This appeal follows.\nANALYSIS\nA motion for involuntary dismissal under section 2—619 admits the legal sufficiency of the complaint but asserts an affirmative defense or other matter that avoids or defeats the claim. DeLuna v. Burciaga, 223 Ill. 2d 49, 59 (2006). “The purpose of a section 2—619 motion is to dispose of issues of law and easily proved issues of fact early in the litigation.” Czarobski v. Lata, 227 Ill. 2d 364, 369 (2008). When ruling on a section 2—619 motion, a court must interpret all pleadings and supporting documents in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Porter v. Decatur Memorial Hospital, 227 Ill. 2d 343, 352 (2008). Our review of a section 2—619 motion to dismiss is de novo. Id.\ne1 Baniassadi filed his motion to dismiss pursuant to section 2—619(a)(5), which provides for involuntary dismissal on the grounds that the action was not commenced within the time limited by law. 735 ILCS 5/2—619(a)(5) (West 2008). The statute of limitations for a legal malpractice action is set forth in section 13—214.3 of the Code, which provides that an action against an attorney for damages based on tort, contract or otherwise arising out of an act or omission in the performance of professional services “must be commenced within 2 years from the time the person bringing the action knew or reasonably should have known of the injury for which damages are sought.” 735 ILCS 5/13—214.3(b) (West 2008). Section 13—214.3 also contains a statute of repose. It provides that an action for legal malpractice “may not be commenced in any event more than 6 years after the date on which the act or omission occurred.” 735 ILCS 5/13—214.3(c) (West 2008).\nIn arguing that the trial court erred in dismissing her complaint as time barred, Kheirkhahvash raises multiple issues, some of which overlap and will be discussed as a single issue. First, Kheirkhahvash contends that the trial court erred in equating her discovery in September 2000 that Baniassadi had filed a false asylum application with the date on which she knew or reasonably should have known of the injury. Kheirkhahvash argues that even if the negligent act occurred on August 1, 2000, with the filing of the false asylum applica tion, and she discovered in September 2000 that a false statement had been filed, she did not realize at that time that she had sustained an injury, nor had she incurred actual damages. Kheirkhahvash further contends that the trial court ignored allegations in the complaint that she was prevented from timely discovering her injuries because of language and cultural barriers.\nAs an initial matter, although both parties’ briefs indicate that the trial court concluded that Kheirkhahvash knew of the alleged negligence in September 2000, we note that the trial court’s order contains no date for when the statute of limitations began to run. It merely states that Kheirkhahvash’s complaint is dismissed with prejudice “as being time barred by the Statute of Limitations of 2 years in contract and 5 years in fraud.” There is nothing in the record to indicate a determination by the trial court as to the date on which Kheirkhahvash knew or reasonably should have known she had a cause of action. There is also no evidence in the record that the trial court “ignored” allegations in the complaint that language and cultural barriers prevented the timely discovery of Kheirkhahvash’s injuries.\nWe now turn to the issue of whether the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint as time barred. We agree with Kheirkhahvash that the statute of limitations did not begin to run in late August/ early September 2000 when Baniassadi faxed her a copy of the personal statement in Farsi and she told him it was false. The general rule in Illinois is that a cause of action for legal malpractice does not accrue until the entry of an adverse judgment, settlement, or dismissal of the underlying action in which the plaintiff has become entangled due to the alleged negligent advice of her attorney. Warnock v. Karm Winand &amp; Patterson, 376 Ill. App. 3d 364, 371-72 (2007). This court has noted that “[tjhere may be rare cases in which it is painfully obvious, prior to any adverse ruling against the plaintiff client, that he has been injured as a result of professional negligence.” Id. at 372. However, this is not such a case. Kheirkhahvash did not speak English or understand the immigration process and relied upon the advice of her attorney. It would not have been obvious to her at that point in time that she would be deported on the basis of the false asylum application. In fact, Baniassadi assured Kheirkhahvash that he had successfully obtained political asylum for other clients on those grounds and that she would be deported if she did not go along with the story. Thus, the earliest date at which the statute of limitations could have started to run is April 24, 2002, the date the immigration judge entered an order finding Kheirkhahvash to be a member of a terrorist organization and ordering her deportation to Iran.\nMoreover, we agree with Kheirkhahvash that due to language and cultural barriers, it is unlikely that she knew or reasonably should have known even at that time that she had a cause of action against Baniassadi, who continued to reassure her that he would appeal the decision and the order would be reversed. However, once Kheirkhahvash obtained new counsel, it can no longer be argued that she should not reasonably have known that she had a cause of action against Baniassadi. Her new counsel obviously knew about the false asylum application and the effect it had on her client, as evidenced by the filing of an ARDC complaint against Baniassadi on those grounds on November 25, 2003. Thus, the very latest date that the statute of limitations could have started to run is November 25, 2003, which means that, barring any applicable exception, her cause of action expired on November 25, 2005, and the trial court correctly dismissed the complaint.\nNext, Kheirkhahvash argues that the court erred in applying the statute of limitations as a bar to this action because the negligence perpetrated by Baniassadi was continuous and Kheirkhahvash incurred increasingly severe injuries. She contends that her complaint was timely filed because Baniassadi committed continuous acts of negligence until December 3, 2003, when he withdrew as Kheirkhahvash’s counsel, at which time the wrongful acts ceased. Thus, because her complaint was filed on August 21, 2009, Kheirkhahvash maintains that it was within the six-year statute of repose and was therefore timely filed.\nWe need not address the issue of whether Baniassadi’s negligence was continuous because this argument has no merit on its face. Even if we were to agree that the statute of repose did not start running until Baniassadi’s withdrawal, the complaint would not have been timely filed under the statute of limitations. A statute of limitations and a statute of repose are not interchangeable. A statute of limitations governs the time within which lawsuits may be filed after a cause of action has accrued, while a statute of repose extinguishes the action itself after a set period of time, regardless of when the action accrued. Ferguson v. McKenzie, 202 Ill. 2d 304, 311 (2001). In Ferguson, our supreme court stated:\n“Unlike a statute of limitations, which begins running upon accrual of a cause of action, a statute of repose begins running when a specific event occurs, regardless of whether an action has accrued or whether an injury has resulted. [Citation.]\nA statute of repose gives effect to a policy different from that advanced by a statute of limitations; it is intended to terminate the possibility of liability after a defined period of time, regardless of a potential plaintiff’s lack of knowledge of his or her cause of action.” Id.\nOnce Baniassadi withdrew as counsel, Kheirkhahvash knew or reasonably should have known that she had a cause of action. A deportation order had been entered on April 24, 2002, so she already knew of her injury. Once she obtained new counsel, it is clear that she knew her injury had been wrongfully caused because she filed an ARDC complaint. Although the attorney consent for withdrawal was received in court December 3, 2003, the document stated that it was effective November 24, 2003, one day prior to the filing of her ARDC complaint against Baniassadi on November 25. Therefore, she knew at that time that she had a cause of action and the statute of limitations began to run. Whether the statute of repose began to run the same day her action accrued or three years earlier is irrelevant. The statute of repose could not operate as a statute of limitations and give her six years instead of two in which to file her action. Under the statute of limitations, her cause of action expired at the latest on November 25, 2005.\nThird, Kheirkhahvash argues that the trial court erred in concluding as a matter of law that her claim was time barred when a factual dispute existed as to when she discovered Baniassadi’s negligence. We note that Kheirkhahvash does not state anywhere in her brief when she believes she discovered Baniassadi’s negligence. She obviously knew she had a cause of action when she filed her complaint on August 21, 2009. Yet she does not point to anything that happened within the two years prior to that date that caused her to suddenly discover Baniassadi’s negligence. She claims that the statute of repose began to run when Baniassadi withdrew as counsel and his wrongful acts ceased. But she also claims that she did not discover that she had a cause of action when she retained her current counsel in November 2003, because Baniassadi did not admit to her current counsel that he had been grossly negligent in his representation. This argument is without merit. It suggests that the only way Kheirkhahvash’s current counsel could have learned of the negligence was through Baniassadi himself.\nIn fact, Kheirkhahvash filed an ARDC complaint on November 25, 2003, in which she requested an investigation of Baniassadi for advising her to file and testify falsely with regard to her asylum application. Her current counsel most certainly knew or should have known at that time that she had a cause of action. Therefore, at the very latest, the statute of limitations began to run on November 25, 2003. While the time when an injured party knew or reasonably should have known of the injury and that it was wrongfully caused is usually a disputed question to be resolved by the finder of fact, if it is apparent from the undisputed facts that only one conclusion can be drawn, the question becomes one for the court. Witherell v. Weimer, 85 Ill. 2d 146, 156 (1981). There is nothing in the record to indicate that there is any possibility that Kheirkhahvash did not know of the negligence at the time she filed the ARDC complaint. Thus, the trial court did not err in determining as a matter of law that her complaint was time barred.\nFinally, Kheirkhahvash contends that under the doctrine of equitable estoppel, Baniassadi is prevented from raising a statute of limitations defense because he engaged in acts of fraudulent concealment. These are actually two separate arguments: (1) that fraudulent concealment by Baniassadi operates as an exception to both the statute of limitations and the statute of repose, and (2) that Baniassadi is equitably estopped from raising a statute of limitations defense.\nWe first address the fraudulent concealment argument. Section 13—215 of the Code provides that if a person liable to an action fraudulently conceals the cause of such action from the knowledge of the person entitled thereto, the action may be commenced at any time within five years after the person discovers that he or she has a cause of action. 735 ILCS 5/13—215 (West 2008). Our supreme court has held that in addition to operating as an exception to the statute of limitations, section 13—215, when applicable, is an exception to the statute of repose in legal malpractice actions. DeLuna, 223 Ill. 2d at 74.\n“As a general matter, one alleging fraudulent concealment must ‘show affirmative acts by the fiduciary designed to prevent the discovery of the action.’ ” Clay v. Kuhl, 189 Ill. 2d 603, 613 (2000) (quoting Hagney v. Lopeman, 147 Ill. 2d 458, 463 (1992)). However, there is a widely recognized exception to this rule in cases where the existence of a fiduciary relationship is clearly established. DeLuna, 223 Ill. 2d at 76 (citing Crowell v. Bilandic, 81 Ill. 2d 422, 428 (1980)). “[A] fiduciary who is silent, and thus fails to fulfill his duty to disclose material facts concerning the existence of a cause of action, has fraudulently concealed that action, even without affirmative acts or representations.” (Emphasis omitted.) Id. at 77. Our supreme court has also recognized that an attorney-client relationship constitutes a fiduciary relationship. Id. (and cases cited therein).\nAlthough it is not necessary to show affirmative acts where a fiduciary relationship has been clearly established, our supreme court has insisted on strict pleading requirements for a plaintiff alleging fraudulent concealment. Hagney v. Lopeman, 147 Ill. 2d 458, 463-64 (1992). Specifically, “to excuse diligence in discovering the fraud, the plaintiff must attribute the failure to discover to the trust and confidence placed in the fiduciary.” Id. at 464. “In order to state a claim for fraudulent concealment, a plaintiff must allege that the defendant concealed a material fact when he was under a duty to disclose that fact to plaintiff.” Connick v. Suzuki Motor Co., 174 Ill. 2d 482, 500 (1996).\nIn DeLuna, the plaintiffs alleged that their attorney failed to reveal pertinent facts, misled them by telling them their case was going well when it had, in fact, been dismissed, and failed to disclose material facts bearing on the procedural status of the case. DeLuna, 223 Ill. 2d at 79-80. Moreover, the plaintiffs alleged that they could not speak English and that they relied in good faith on their attorney’s reassurances. Id. at 80-81. The supreme court held that these allegations were sufficient to meet the pleading requirements for fraudulent concealment. Id. at 81.\nHere, it is doubtful that Kheirkhahvash’s complaint meets the pleading requirements. The complaint does not contain any reference to fraudulent concealment. In her fraud count, Kheirkhahvash focuses on Baniassadi’s intentional, knowing, and willful conduct in filing a false application rather than on his representations and assurances to her and her trust in those assurances. Moreover, even if we were to determine that Kheirkhahvash’s complaint meets the pleading requirements for fraudulent concealment, it cannot save her legal malpractice action. As noted above, section 13—215 operates as an exception to both the statute of limitations and the statute of repose. Thus, if the statute of repose had already run and Kheirkhahvash successfully pled fraudulent concealment, section 13—215 would give her an additional five years from the time she discovered that she had a cause of action in which to file her complaint. However, it is well settled in Illinois law that if a reasonable amount of time remains in the applicable limitations period when the plaintiff discovers the cause of action, section 13—215 will not extend that period. See, e.g., Leffler v. Engler, Zoghlin &amp; Mann, Ltd., 157 Ill. App. 3d 718, 721 (1987); Barratt v. Goldberg, 296 Ill. App. 3d 252, 258 (1998) (and cases cited therein).\nBaniassadi filed the false asylum application on August 1, 2000. Thus, under the statute of repose, Kheirkhahvash’s cause of action would extinguish on August 1, 2006. At the very latest, she knew she had a cause of action at the time she retained new counsel and filed a complaint against Baniassadi with the ARDC on November 25, 2003. At that time, almost three years remained under the statute of repose. Moreover, under Kheirkhahvash’s argument that the statute of repose did not start to run until Baniassadi withdrew, there would have been six years remaining under the statute of repose. Thus, under both possible dates, a reasonable amount of time remained such that even if Kheirkhahvash successfully pled fraudulent concealment, it would operate only as a possible exception to the statute of limitations and not as an exception to the statute of repose.\nSimilarly, fraudulent concealment does not save her malpractice action as an exception to the statute of limitations. Assuming, arguendo, that Kheirkhahvash’s cause of action accrued on April 24, 2002, when the deportation order was entered, her cause of action would have expired on April 24, 2004. She could then argue that when she discovered the fraudulent concealment on November 25, 2003, the amount of time remaining under the statute of limitations was not reasonable. However, even if her complaint sufficiently pled fraudulent concealment and section 13—215 operated as an exception to the statute of limitations, she would only have had five years from the time she learned of the cause of action, which would have given her until November 25, 2008. She did not file her complaint until August 21, 2009. Therefore, her complaint was untimely under section 13—215.\nWe similarly reject Kheirkhahvash’s equitable estoppel argument. In order for a plaintiff to invoke estoppel against a statute of limitations defense, “the plaintiff must have relied on acts or representations of the defendant which caused the plaintiff to refrain from filing suit within the applicable statute of limitations.” Leffler, 157 Ill. App. 3d at 722-23. However, “[t]he doctrine of equitable estoppel will not apply to a case if defendant’s conduct terminated within ample time to allow the plaintiff an opportunity to file a cause of action within the limitation period.” Barratt, 296 Ill. App. 3d at 259. Baniassadi’s conduct terminated on November 24, 2003. This is roughly the same time that Kheirkhahvash filed an ARDC complaint against Baniassadi, evidence that she knew or reasonably should have known that her injury was wrongfully caused. She then had two years under the statute of limitations for legal malpractice actions to file her claim and therefore, the doctrine of equitable estoppel does not apply.\nAs a final matter, we address defendant’s request for sanctions under Illinois Supreme Court Rule 375 (eff. Feb. 1, 1994). Rule 375(b) provides that if a reviewing court determines that an appeal is frivolous, or that it was not taken in good faith or for an improper purpose, an appropriate sanction may be imposed upon the party or the attorney of the party. Ill. S. Ct. R. 375(b) (eff. Feb. 1, 1994). However, as defendant also correctly notes, the imposition of sanctions is a matter left strictly to the appellate court’s discretion. Residential Carpentry, Inc. v. Illinois Workers’ Compensation Comm’n, 389 Ill. App. 3d 975, 976 (2009). We agree that there is little or no merit to this appeal but in the exercise of our discretion, we decline to impose sanctions.\nCONCLUSION\n•2 Based on the foregoing analysis, we hold that the trial court did not err in determining as a matter of law that Kheirkhahvash’s complaint was time barred. Under the most generous interpretation of the facts, the latest date at which she knew or reasonably should have known of her injury and that it was wrongfully caused is November 25, 2003. Thus, under the statute of limitations for legal malpractice actions, her cause of action expired on November 25, 2005. We further conclude that her claim that her complaint was timely filed under the six-year statute of repose because defendant’s continuous negligent actions did not cease until he withdrew as counsel on November 24, 2003, is without merit. A statute of repose does not operate as a statute of limitations and give a plaintiff six years in which to file instead of two after a cause of action accrues. Finally, even if we were to determine that her complaint met the pleading requirements for fraudulent concealment and tolled the statute of limitations, her cause of action would have expired on November 25, 2008. Moreover, equitable estoppel does not apply because defendant’s conduct terminated at the time her cause of action accrued, allowing ample time to file her complaint within the two-year statute of limitations.\nAffirmed.\nBotTa the complaint and appellant’s brief state that Kheirkhahvash was detained on October 10, 2003, and released February 24, 2004, under an order of supervision. Documents filed by the appellee state that Kheirkhahvash was detained on October 10, 2002, and was released February 4, 2003. The only official document in the record relating to the detention is an order of supervision dated February 4, 2003. Thus, because Kheirkhahvash was released from custody in February 2003, we conclude she was in fact detained in October 2002.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}]
[{&#39;author&#39;: &#39;PRESIDING JUSTICE GALLAGHER&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &#39;PRESIDING JUSTICE GALLAGHER\ndelivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\nJustices Hoffman and Lavin concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nOPINION\nPetitioner Mark Thompson appeals from an order of the Illinois State Board of Elections (Board) dismissing his complaint against respondents Elizabeth Gorman and The Gorman Good Government Group (Group). On appeal, petitioner contends that this court should reverse the Board’s dismissal of his petition and remand for further proceedings because he demonstrated justifiable grounds for further proceedings before the Board. We affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\nBACKGROUND\nOn January 11, 2010, petitioner filed a complaint with the Board in which he alleged, inter alia, that respondents violated section 9—11 of the Election Code (10 ILCS 5/9—11 (West 2002)) by falsely reporting the identity of the parties that loaned the Group $390,000 in 2002 and reporting a false recipient for an expenditure of $100,080 that was made by the Group on June 28, 2002. Petitioner also alleged that respondents violated section 9—25 of the Election Code (10 ILCS 5/9—25 (West 2002)) by receiving contributions made in the name of another person, in that $390,000 in loans was received by the Group in 2002 from “Dodge of Midlothian” and “Sales, Inc.,” businesses owned by Gerald and Elizabeth Gorman, and its reports were then amended in 2004 to reflect that Gerald Gorman made those loans. Petitioner further alleged that respondents violated sections 9—8.10(a)(3) and 9—8.10(a)(4) of the Election Code (10 ILCS 5/9—8.10(a)(3), (a)(4) (West 2006)) by making expenditures to Gerald Gorman to reimburse him for mortgage payments he had made on a personal residence and violated section 9—8.10(a)(11) of the Election Code (10 ILCS 5/9—8.10(a)(11) (West 2002)) by making multiple expenditures to Gerald Gorman for services that he had not actually rendered.\nA closed preliminary hearing was conducted on February 3, 2010, by a hearing examiner for the Board, and on February 7, 2010, the hearing examiner filed a written report in which he summarized the proceedings and made conclusions and recommendations. The examiner’s report reflects that petitioner presented a summary of a semiannual report for the period of January 1 through June 30, 2002, that was believed to have been filed by the Group with the Board on July 31, 2002, and a summary of a semiannual report for the period of January 16 through June 30, 2002, that was believed to have been filed by the Group with the Board on March 9, 2004. Petitioner also presented summaries of the semiannual reports for the periods of January 1 through June 30, 2005, and January 1, 2006, through June 30, 2009. Each of the summaries contained receipts, expenditures, debts, obligations, and a funds balance of the Group for that reporting period. In addition, petitioner presented the dockets of two complaints for mortgage foreclosure by First Suburban National Bank (FSNB) against various parties, including Elizabeth Gorman and her husband Gerald.\nPetitioner asserted that the evidence showed that the Group originally reported that Dodge of Midlothian and Sales, Inc., made loans to the Group in 2002, but later amended the report to reflect that the loans were made by Gerald Gorman, and that the Group originally reported that it made a payment of $100,080 to Sales, Inc., in 2002, but later amended the report to reflect that the payment was made to Gerald Gorman. Petitioner argued that the evidence thus showed that the 2002 payment was made to Gerald Gorman and that the Group falsely reported that it was made to Sales, Inc. Petitioner also asserted that the evidence showed that the Group made numerous expenditures to Gerald Gorman from March 2006 through March 2009 as repayment for loans that he never actually made to the Group and that three payments made to Gerald Gorman in 2007 for the stated purpose of “Partial Repayment of Loan for FSNB” were used to reimburse mortgage payments on property owned by Gerald and Elizabeth Gorman in relation to mortgage foreclosure proceedings filed against them by FSNB.\nPeg Walsh, a representative of the Group, testified for respondents that it was her understanding that the Group initially reported that the loans at issue were made by Dodge of Midlothian and Sales, Inc., because the Group’s accountants advised that it do so and that Gerald Gorman was advised to amend the reports because it would have been more proper to show that the loans were coming from him, since he was the owner of those two companies and they “were used as collateral on the loans.” Brent Woods, a former treasurer of the Group, amended the reports to show that the $100,080 payment was made to Gerald Gorman, and not Sales, Inc., according to the instructions he had received from the Board. In addition, Gerald Gorman had a personal account at FSNB, and that bank was referenced by the Group in the purpose statements of three 2007 expenditures for loan repayments in its semiannual report to the Board to indicate into which bank those payments had been deposited.\nElizabeth Gorman testified that Gerald Gorman owned at least 90% of both Dodge of Midlothian and Sales, Inc., and that the reports were changed to reflect more accurately that the loans were made by Gerald. Elizabeth further testified that Woods had many conversations with the Board on how to amend correctly the reports to reflect that the $100,080 payment was made to Gerald and that the reports accurately reflected that all loan payments were made to Gerald because he was the person responsible for making all the loans at issue, regardless of who was originally listed.\nThe hearing examiner recommended that petitioner’s complaint be found not to have been filed upon justifiable grounds and that the matter not proceed to a public hearing. In doing so, the examiner concluded that regardless of whether Gerald Gorman provided the Group the loans at issue as an individual or as the owner of a business, he could have been listed as the person providing the loans because he was personally responsible for them. The examiner also concluded that any shortcomings in the report regarding the $100,080 payment to Sales, Inc., were corrected when the reports were amended. In addition, the examiner concluded that petitioner did not provide any evidence to establish that the three payments made to Gerald Gorman in 2007 for the stated purpose of “Partial Repayment of Loan for FSNB” were anything other than properly made partial loan repayments. On March 8, 2010, the Board issued a written order dismissing petitioner’s complaint, finding that it was not filed on justifiable grounds.\nPetitioner appealed from that order and this court remanded the matter to the Board for a statement of findings regarding the reasons it determined that petitioner’s complaint was not filed on justifiable grounds. Thompson v. Gorman, 405 Ill. App. 3d 979 (2010). On December 3, 2010, the Board entered an order adopting the hearing examiner’s recommendation and dismissing petitioner’s complaint on the basis that it was not filed on justifiable grounds.\nANALYSIS\nPetitioner contends on appeal that the Board erred in dismissing his complaint because he demonstrated justifiable grounds for further proceedings. Any person may file a verified complaint with the Board alleging a campaign finance violation under the Election Code. 10 ILCS 5/9—20 (West 2008). Upon receipt of the complaint, the Board is required to hold a closed preliminary hearing to determine whether the complaint appears to have been filed on justifiable grounds, and the Board shall dismiss the complaint without further hearing if it fails to determine that it had been so filed. 10 ILCS 5/9—21 (West 2008). Any party adversely affected by a judgment of the Board may obtain judicial review directly in the appellate court for the district in which the cause of action arose, and that review shall be governed by the provisions of the Administrative Review Law (735 ILCS 5/3—101 et seq. (West 2008)) and its accompanying rules. 10 ILCS 5/9—22 (West 2008).\nThe purpose of a closed preliminary hearing is to elicit evidence on whether the complaint was filed on justifiable grounds and has some basis in fact and law. 26 Ill. Adm. Code 125.252 (2010). The complainant bears the burden of introducing sufficient evidence or information for the Board to conclude that the complaint has been filed on justifiable grounds. 26 Ill. Adm. Code 125.252(c)(4) (2010). The justifiable grounds standard focuses on the factual and legal sufficiency of the complaint, and “[t]he essential inquiry is whether the complaint is factually and legally justified.” Cook County Republican Party v. Illinois State Board of Elections, 232 Ill. 2d 231, 245 (2009).\nThe determination of whether a complaint has been filed on justifiable grounds presents a mixed question of fact and law, and we therefore review the Board’s dismissal of petitioner’s complaint to determine whether the Board clearly erred in deciding that the complaint was not filed on justifiable grounds. Id. An administrative agency’s decision will be deemed clearly erroneous where the record leaves the reviewing court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made. Cinkus v. Village of Stickney Municipal Officers Electoral Board, 228 Ill. 2d 200, 211 (2008).\nI. Counts I and II\nPetitioner first asserts that the Board’s decision that the first two counts of his complaint were not filed on justifiable grounds is clearly erroneous. In count I, petitioner alleged that respondents violated section 9—11 of the Election Code by falsely reporting the identity of the parties that loaned $390,000 to the Group in 2002 and/or violated section 9—25 of the Election Code by receiving $390,000 in loans made in the name of another person. In count II, petitioner alleged that respondents violated section 9—11 of the Election Code by falsely reporting the recipient of an expenditure of $100,080 made by the Group on June 28, 2002.\nEach report of campaign contributions shall disclose “each loan to or from any person within the reporting period by or to such committee in an aggregate amount or value in excess of $150, together with the full names and mailing addresses of the lender and endorsers, if any, and the date and amount of such loans.” 10 ILCS 5/9—11(8) (West 2002). In addition, “no person shall knowingly accept any anonymous contribution or contribution made by one person in the name of another person.” 10 ILCS 5/9—25 (West 2002).\nThe semiannual reports filed by the Group with the Board show that respondents initially reported on July 31, 2002, that the Group had received loans from Dodge of Midlothian of $40,000 on January 16; $50,000 on February 7; $125,000 on March 11; and $110,000 on June 28, 2002; and had received a loan of $50,000 from Sales, Inc., on February 22, 2002. The reports also show that respondents reported on March 9, 2004, that Gerald Gorman was the creditor on those loans and that $100,080 of the $110,000 loan made on June 28, 2002, had been repaid. As such, the evidence shows that the Group must have reported the incorrect identity of the lender on at least one occasion because the loans could not have been made by Dodge of Midlothian and Sales Inc., as originally reported, and also by Gerald Gorman.\nHowever, in concluding that the first count of petitioner’s complaint was not filed on justifiable grounds, the hearing examiner determined that “whether Gerald Gorman as the owner of a business or Gerald Gorman the individual gave the loans, the person who was ultimately responsible for the loan can be listed as the loaner. In this case [Elizabeth Gorman] has stated that Gerald Gorman is personally responsible for these loans.” In addition, according to the hearing examiner’s report, Elizabeth Gorman testified that Gerald Gorman owned at least 90% of both Dodge of Midlothian and Sales, Inc., that “the loaner being Dodge of Midlothian and Sales Inc., [sic] were her husband Gerald Gorman,” and that “the reports were changed to more accurately reflect Gerald Gorman.”\n“It is a well-established principle that a corporation is separate and distinct as a legal entity from its shareholders, directors and officers ***.” Main Bank of Chicago v. Baker, 86 Ill. 2d 188, 204 (1981). This is true even in a closely-held corporation in which the stock is held in a few hands. Gallagher v. Reconco Builders, Inc., 91 Ill. App. 3d 999, 1004 (1980). Thus, “[t]he law is clear that payments made by a corporation may not be attributed to individual shareholders because corporations and shareholders are distinct legal entities.” Trossman v. Philipsborn, 373 Ill. App. 3d 1020, 1048 (2007). As such, respondents could not have accurately reported that the loans at issue had been made by Gerald Gorman if they were made by Dodge of Midlothian and Sales, Inc., or vice versa, because the corporations and Gerald Gorman the individual are distinct legal entities. To the extent that the record indicates that the hearing examiner, the Board, and Elizabeth Gorman believed otherwise because Gerald Gorman owned at least 90% of both Dodge of Midlothian and Sales Inc., we disagree.\nMoreover, the evidence does not establish that Gerald Gorman made or “was ultimately responsible for” the loans at issue. Respondents initially reported that the loans were made by Dodge of Midlothian and Sales, Inc. The hearing examiner indicated in his report that he concluded that “the loans were from Gerald Gorman” because Elizabeth Gorman had testified to that effect at the preliminary hearing. However, as noted above, the testimony of Elizabeth Gorman appears to have been based on the incorrect assumption that any loans made by Dodge of Midlothian and Sales, Inc., could have been attributed to Gerald Gorman as an individual because he owned at least 90% of each corporation.\nIn addition, Peg Walsh’s testimony that it was her understanding that the reports had been amended because Dodge of Midlothian and Sales, Inc., “were used as collateral on the loans and it would be more proper to show the loans coming from Mr. Gorman,” does not establish that Gerald Gorman made the loans and raises more questions than it answers. We initially note that Walsh testified as to “her understanding of the situation,” which indicates that she did not have firsthand knowledge of the reason the reports had been amended. Moreover, Walsh did not explain how the corporations were or could have been “used as collateral on the loans.” To create a security interest by a debtor in favor of a creditor, one requirement is that the debtor must have or acquire rights in the collateral. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. American National Bank &amp; Trust Co., 288 Ill. App. 3d 760, 766 (1997). There is no evidence in the record that the Group, the debtor, had an ownership interest in either of the corporations. Moreover, if Gerald Gorman had made the loans to the Group, as respondents ultimately reported, it would not make sense for him to pledge his ownership interests in the corporations as collateral because he would have been the creditor, not the debtor.\nAs such, the implausible and oftentimes confusing explanations provided by Elizabeth Gorman and Peg Walsh regarding the reasons the reports were amended to reflect that Gerald Gorman was the lender do not shed any light as to the identity of the party or parties that made the loans at issue and actually diminish this court’s confidence that the reports are accurate. In addition, respondents did not present any other evidence, such as a written loan agreement, to show that the loans were made by Gerald Gorman. Thus, it is unclear from the record which of the reports filed by respondents are accurate as to the identity of the party or parties that made the loans at issue. We therefore determine that petitioner’s allegation, set forth in count I of his complaint, that respondents violated section 9—11 of the Election Code by falsely reporting the identity of the parties that loaned the Group $390,000 in 2002 has some basis in fact and law and appears to have been filed on justifiable grounds and conclude that the Board’s decision to the contrary is clearly erroneous.\nIn reaching that conclusion, we have considered Troy v. State Board of Elections, 84 Ill. App. 3d 740, 743-44 (1980), cited by respondents, in which this court affirmed the Board’s dismissal of the petitioner’s complaint because the evidence presented by the petitioner was insufficient to provide reasonable grounds for further inquiry, the respondent presented evidence rebutting the petitioner’s allegations, and the petitioner challenged activity that was not regulated by the Election Code. Respondents assert that the facts in this case are similar to those in Troy because in this case petitioner did not allege that they failed to fully disclose the loans made to the Group and did not produce any evidence except for the disclosure forms that had already been filed with the Board.\nThe record shows, however, that petitioner alleged in his complaint that respondents violated section 9—11 of the Election Code by falsely reporting the identity of the party or parties that made the loans at issue. In addition, the semiannual reports presented by petitioner and the unconvincing testimony provided by Elizabeth Gorman and Peg Walsh provide reasonable grounds for further inquiry to determine the identity of the party or parties which loaned the Group $390,000 in 2002.\nOn direct review of an order of an administrative agency, this court is vested with all the powers provided to the circuit court in section 3—111 of the Administrative Review Law (735 ILCS 5/3—111 (West 2008)). Ill. S. Ct. R. 335(i)(2) (eff. Feb. 1, 1994). As such, this court may affirm or reverse the Board’s decision in whole or in part (735 ILCS 5/3—111(a)(5), (a)(6) (West 2008)), and we therefore now consider whether the remaining counts in petitioner’s complaint were filed on justifiable grounds.\nTo the extent that petitioner maintains that the Board clearly erred by dismissing count II of his complaint, we disagree. In count II, petitioner alleged that respondents violated section 9—11 of the Election Code by falsely reporting the recipient of an expenditure of $100,080 made by the Group on June 28, 2002. However, section 9—11 of the Election Code (10 ILCS 5/9—11 (West 2002)) only addresses disclosure requirements for contributions received by respondents, and not the disclosure requirements regarding their expenditures and the identity of persons to whom they owe debts or obligations, which are addressed in section 9—13 (10 ILCS 5/9—13(12), (15) (West 2002)). Thus, count II of petitioner’s complaint has no basis in law, and we therefore conclude that the Board did not clearly err by dismissing that count for not being filed on justifiable grounds.\nII. Counts IV and V\nIn counts IV and V of his complaint, petitioner alleged that respondents violated sections 9—8.10(a)(3) and 9—8.10(a)(4) of the Election Code by making expenditures to Gerald Gorman to reimburse him for mortgage payments made on a personal residence. A political committee shall not make expenditures “[flor satisfaction or repayment of any debts other than loans made to the committee or to the public official or candidate on behalf of the committee or repayment of goods and services purchased by the committee under a credit agreement.” 10 ILCS 5/9—8.10(a)(3) (West 2006). In addition, a political committee shall not make expenditures “[flor the satisfaction or repayment of any debts or for the payment of any expenses relating to a personal residence.” 10 ILCS 5/9—8.10(a)(4) (West 2006).\nThe semiannual report filed by the Group with the Board for the period of July 1 through December 31, 2007, shows that the Group made three expenditures totaling $8,000 to Gerald Gorman on July 31, October 4, and November 5, 2007, and that the stated purpose for each expenditure was “Partial Repayment of Loan for FSNB.” The semiannual reports filed by the Group for the periods of January 1, 2006, through June 30, 2007, and July 1, 2008, through June 30, 2009, show that the Group made 18 expenditures totaling $37,075 to Gerald Gorman during those periods of time and that the stated purpose for each expenditure was “Partial Repayment of Loan.” The record also shows that FSNB filed two mortgage foreclosure complaints against multiple defendants, including Elizabeth and Gerald Gorman, on April 3, 2009.\nAt the closed preliminary hearing, Peg Walsh testified that Gerald Gorman had a personal account at FSNB and that the bank was included in the purpose statement for the expenditures at issue to indicate into which bank those payments had been deposited. Elizabeth Gorman testified that the expenditures were partial loan repayments made to Gerald Gorman and that FSNB was included in the purpose statements to reflect that the funds were deposited into Gerald’s personal account at that bank.\nThe hearing examiner concluded that counts IV and V of petitioner’s complaint were not filed on justifiable grounds. In doing so, he stated that Walsh and Elizabeth Gorman had testified that the expenditures at issue were partial loan repayments and determined that petitioner had not provided any evidence showing otherwise.\nWe decide, however, that petitioner presented sufficient evidence at the preliminary hearing to provide the allegations made in counts IV and V of his complaint with some basis in fact and law. The semiannual reports show that the Group reported that the expenditures at is sue were made for the purpose of “Partial Repayment of Loan for FSNB,” but also reported that all other expenditures made to Gerald Gorman from January 2006 through June 2009 were made for the purpose of “Partial Repayment of Loan.” Although Walsh and Elizabeth Gorman testified that FSNB was included in the purpose statements to signify that the expenditures at issue were to be deposited into Gerald Gorman’s personal account at FSNB, they did not explain why the purpose statements for the other expenditures made to Gerald Gorman did not also include a notation regarding the bank into which the funds had been deposited. In addition, the expenditures at issue were described as being made for FSNB, rather than to FSNB or at FSNB, which were more accurate ways to signify that the payments had been deposited in Gerald Gorman’s personal account at that bank.\nAs such, the semiannual reports and the mortgage foreclosure complaints, the existence of which indicate that the Gormans were most likely making mortgage payments to FSNB at the time the Group made the expenditures at issue, provide support for petitioner’s claim that respondents violated sections 9—8.10(a)(3) and 9—8.10(a)(4) of the Election Code by using the Group’s funds to reimburse Gerald Gorman for payments made on the Gormans’ mortgage with FSNB. The testimony of Walsh and Elizabeth Gorman did not effectively rebut that claim, and respondents did not present any other evidence, documentary or otherwise, to support their assertion that the expenditures were proper partial loan repayments made to Gerald Gorman’s personal account at FSNB. As such, we determine that the hearing examiner’s conclusion, which was adopted by the Board, that petitioner did not present any evidence showing that the expenditures at issue were anything other than partial loan repayments is clearly erroneous. We therefore also decide that counts IV and V of petitioner’s complaint have some basis in fact and law and appear to have been filed on justifiable grounds and conclude that the Board’s decision to dismiss those counts is clearly erroneous.\nIII. Count VII\nIn count VII of his complaint, petitioner alleged that respondents violated section 9—8.10(a)(11) of the Election Code by making expenditures to Gerald Gorman for loans that he never made and for services that he never rendered. A political committee shall not make an expenditure for payments to a public official’s family member unless it is “compensation for services actually rendered by that person.” 10 ILCS 5/9—8.10(a)(11) (West 2002).\nThe semiannual reports filed by the Group with the Board show that the Group made numerous alleged partial loan repayments to Gerald Gorman from 2002 through 2009. Having already decided that the identity of the party that loaned the Group $390,000 in 2002 is unclear from the evidence presented at the closed preliminary hearing, we now also determine that petitioner’s allegation that the Group made expenditures to Gerald Gorman for repayment of loans that he never made has some basis in fact and law and appears to have been filed on justifiable grounds. We therefore conclude that the Board’s dismissal of count VII for not being filed on justifiable grounds is clearly erroneous.\nPetitioner has not challenged the Board’s dismissal of the remaining counts of his complaint in this appeal. Accordingly, we affirm the portions of the Board’s order dismissing counts II, III, VI, and VIII of petitioner’s complaint and reverse the portions of the Board’s order dismissing counts I, IV V and VII. We therefore remand the matter to the Board to order a public hearing to be conducted on counts I, IY V and VII of petitioner’s complaint in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Election Code (10 ILCS 5/9—21 (West 2008)) and the Administrative Code (26 Ill. Adm. Code 125.310 et seq. (2010)).\nAffirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}]
[{&#39;author&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE EPSTEIN&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE EPSTEIN\ndelivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\nPresiding Justice Fitzgerald Smith and Justice Joseph Gordon concurred in the judgement and opinion.\nOPINION\nIn April 2009, respondent, Joshua B., was adjudicated delinquent, placed on probation, and ordered to perform community service. He appeals, claiming the trial court denied him due process by not advising him of his right to testify and not verifying that he was knowingly and voluntarily waiving that right. He also claims the trial court’s order must be modified because his probation impermissibly extends beyond his twenty-first birthday. For the reasons below, we affirm as modified.\nBACKGROUND\nIn November 2008, the State filed a petition for adjudication of wardship claiming respondent, who was 16 years old, robbed a fellow student. The student and an adult witness identified respondent as the robber in separate photo arrays and testified at his delinquency proceeding. Respondent, who was represented by counsel, called his girlfriend, mother, and father as alibi witnesses. They testified that respondent was at home talking to his girlfriend on a landline telephone at the time of the robbery. Respondent, who was not advised by the trial court of his right to testify, did not testify. The trial court adjudicated respondent delinquent, stating:\n“We have witnesses, two eyewitnesses, to the event which is not often the case. Both of the eyewitnesses told internally consistent versions of what happened. There was not contradiction between one or the other.\nWhat I find compelling evidence here, too, is that both of the eyewitnesses identified the young man, Joshua B***, in photo arrays that — I believe one was held at the police station and I think the other one was at the house of Joshua B*** [sic]. So, these are obviously not done contemporaneously. So, we didn’t have a situation where it could be argued that one witness suggested an identification of another witness. They both picked out the same photo from that array.\nYou know, standing by themselves, each of those witnesses — I have big problems with a single-witness-identification case without other corroboration. We have two witnesses that both gave very compelling and consistent testimony that was very credible.\nOn the other side, we have an alibi defense that was put forth by family members. And I understand that that’s often what wit nesses are. There was — You know, it was interesting to me that the alibi defense really turned on phone calls; and yet, no corroboration of the phone calls was produced by way of records which is something that is available to the two people by way of subpoena and that that might have made an alibi a little bit more compelling than it was because there were inconsistencies between the stories.\nAnd so, I find that the State has proved this case beyond a reasonable doubt. I find that State’s witnesses more credible; and so, there will be a finding of delinquency, finding of guilty.”\nThe trial court placed respondent on 5 years’ probation, until April 7, 2014, and ordered him to perform 60 hours of community service. Respondent appeals, claiming the trial court denied him due process by failing to advise him of his right to testify and failing to verify that he knowingly and voluntarily waived that right. He also claims, and the State does not dispute, that his probation must be modified because it impermissibly extends beyond his twenty-first birthday.\nANALYSIS\nA. Respondent’s Adjudication Is Affirmed\n“A criminal defendant has a constitutional right to testify in his own defense, but that right may be waived. [Citation.] In order to effect waiver of his right to testify, a defendant is not required to execute a specific type of waiver, nor is the trial court required to ascertain whether a defendant’s silence is the result of a knowing and voluntary waiver to testify.” People v. Chatman, 357 Ill. App. 3d 695, 703 (2005).\n“When a defendant contends on appeal that he was precluded from testifying at trial, however, his conviction cannot be reversed on the basis that he was precluded from exercising his right to testify, unless he contemporaneously asserted his right to testify by informing the trial court that he wished to do so.” People v. Shelton, 252 Ill. App. 3d 193, 201 (1993).\nAccord People v. Smith, 176 Ill. 2d 217, 234 (1997). Respondent did not do so here, forfeiting the issue.\nWe will nonetheless examine the record for plain error, “a narrow and limited exception to the general waiver rule.” People v. Pastorino, 91 Ill. 2d 178, 188 (1982). It applies\n“when (1) a clear or obvious error occurred and the evidence is so closely balanced that the error alone threatened to tip the scales of justice against the defendant, regardless of the seriousness of the error, or (2) a clear or obvious error occurred and that error is so serious that it affected the fairness of the defendant’s trial and challenged the integrity of the judicial process, regardless of the closeness of the evidence.” People v. Piatkowski, 225 Ill. 2d 551, 565 (2007).\nRespondent claims the trial court erred by not informing him of his right to testify and not verifying that he knowingly and voluntarily waived that right. We find no such error.\n“Illinois courts have long held that when a defendant is represented by counsel, the trial court does not have a duty to tell a defendant of his right to testify. [Citation.] Rather, it is the defense counsel’s responsibility to advise a defendant about his right to testify and to explain any advantages or disadvantages of invoking that right. [Citation.] However, the ultimate decision of whether to testify is made by the defendant. [Citation.]\nWhen a defendant is represented by counsel, it is left to the discretion of the trial court whether to inform the defendant of the right against self-incrimination.” People v. Vaughn, 354 Ill. App. 3d 917, 925 (2004).\nRespondent acknowledges these principles, but maintains juvenile offenders are entitled to greater protection because “unlike an adult convicted felon, under prevailing law a juvenile offender has no right to file a post-conviction petition.” This court has expressly held that the Post-Conviction Hearing Act (725 ILCS 5/122 — 1 (West 2008)), a collateral remedy for most adult offenders, does not apply to juveniles. In re Thomas, 77 Ill. App. 3d 299, 300 (1979). Our supreme court recently declined to rule on the issue, however, stating:\n“J.T. requests this court to exercise its supervisory authority and address the issue of whether juveniles can seek relief under the Post-Conviction Hearing Act (725 ILCS 5/122 — 1 et seq. (West 2004)). We decline to do so for the same reasons we declined to address this issue in In re William M., 206 Ill. 2d 595 (2003). As in William M., the parties offer minimal argument on this issue. As Justice Kilbride noted in his special concurrence in that case, ‘[a] question of such magnitude should be fully briefed and argued by opposing parties zealously advocating the relevant arguments prior to its definitive resolution by this court.’ William M., 206 Ill. 2d at 607-08 (Kilbride, J., specially concurring).” In re J.T., 221 Ill. 2d 338, 348-49 (2006).\nNevertheless, in holding that criminal court judges have no duty to advise defendants of their right to testify this court identified three factors underlying that ruling unrelated to postconviction proceedings:\n“First, a defendant’s decision as to whether or not to testify is often made as the trial unfolds. [Citation.] By advising a defendant of his right to testify, a court could influence the defendant to waive his right not to testify, ‘thus threatening the exercise of this other, converse, constitutionally explicit and more fragile right.’ [Citations.]\nSecond, a court could intrude upon the attorney-client relationship by advising a defendant of his right to testify. [Citations.] ‘A trial judge must take great care not to assume the functions of trial counsel.’ [Citation.] It is primarily the responsibility of defense counsel, not the trial judge, to advise a defendant as to whether or not he should testify and to explain the tactical advantages and disadvantages of each option. [Citation.] If a trial judge were to advise a defendant, sua sponte, of his right to testify, such an act could frustrate a decision on the matter made by the defendant and defense counsel who are designing trial strategy. [Citation.]\nFinally, a trial judge is not required to inform a defendant of his right to testify because it is difficult for a judge to determine the appropriate time that he should advise a defendant concerning his right to testify, since ‘the judge cannot know that the defendant has not testified until the defense [rests and such a moment is not an opportune] time to engage in a discussion with the defendant which might lead to a rupture with defense counsel *** or might undo a trial strategy based on the defendant’s not testifying.’ [Citation.]” (Emphasis in original and omitted.) Shelton, 252 Ill. App. 3d at 202.\nWe find all of these factors equally applicable to proceedings under the Juvenile Court Act of 1987 (705 ILCS 405/1 et seq. (West 2008)) (the Act), and note that section 1 — 5 of the Act assures that minors will be represented by counsel. 705 ILCS 405/1 — 5 (West 2008) (“No hearing on any petition or motion filed under this Act may be commenced unless the minor who is the subject of the proceeding is represented by counsel”). We therefore decline to adopt the bright-line rule advocated by respondent, and hold that the trial court did not have a duty to inform respondent sua sponte, who was represented by counsel, of his right to testify or verify that respondent was knowingly and voluntarily waiving that right.\nWe note that respondent does not actually claim that counsel did not advise him of his right to testify. While respondent argues that he cannot “reveal conversations he did or did not have with his attorney” because such matters are outside of the record, and “on direct appeal a reviewing court will not consider facts that are not part of the record,” that argument fails. If indeed respondent’s counsel did not inform him of his right to testify respondent could have made that assertion in his briefs to the court, noting that the matters were outside of the record, and presented his perceived inability to raise them before the trial court. See People v. Henderson, 217 Ill. 2d 449, 467-68 (2005). That would have allowed the State to respond to his claim and provided us a basis upon which to determine whether to consider his purported claim. Under this record, there is no claim before us regarding counsel’s conduct. We find no plain error and affirm respondent’s adjudication.\nB. Respondent’s Probation Is Modified\nOn April 7, 2009, the trial court placed respondent on 5 years’ probation, until April 7, 2014, and ordered him to perform 60 hours of community service. As section 5 — 755 of the Act (705 ILCS 405/5— 755 (West 2008)) requires respondent’s probation to terminate on his twenty-first birthday, June 27, 2013, we modify the trial court’s order accordingly.\nCONCLUSION\nRespondent has forfeited his due process claim, and the trial court did not commit plain error as it did not have a duty to inform respondent sua sponte of his right to testify or verify that respondent was voluntarily and knowingly waiving that right. We affirm the trial court’s order as modified.\nAffirmed as modified.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}]
[{&#39;author&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE EPSTEIN&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE EPSTEIN\ndelivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\nJustices Joseph Gordon and Howse concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nOPINION\nFollowing a jury trial, defendant Marcos Garcia was found guilty of the first degree murder of Bonita McConnell and sentenced to 47 years of imprisonment. Defendant appeals, contending that: (1) the State failed to prove him guilty of first degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt; and (2) the State made prejudicial comments during its opening statement and closing and rebuttal arguments, depriving defendant of a fair trial. Defendant asks that we reduce his conviction to involuntary manslaughter or second degree murder and remand for resentencing, or that we reverse his conviction and remand for a new trial. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\nBACKGROUND\nOn July 31, 2005, Bonita McConnell was shot in the head and killed by a stray bullet while driving with her sister, Joyce Brooks, down Cicero Avenue in Chicago, Illinois.\nEarlier that day, defendant and his friends Peter Johnson, Juan Campos, and Rudy Cantu drove to a Wal-Mart store near the intersection of Cicero Avenue and West 72nd Street. All four men were part of or affiliated with the same street gang, the Two-Two Boys. While at the Wal-Mart, defendant and his friends attracted the attention of rival gang members Fidel Morales, Rene Jaime, and Gustavio Melecio. Although the men did not know each other, they recognized each other’s gang colors. The groups exchanged threatening looks, but no words, and hurried to their vehicles after leaving the store; defendant and his friends to Johnson’s blue Dodge Grand Caravan, and Morales and his friends to a black Lincoln Town Car.\nJohnson, a friend and coworker of defendant, testified that he was closely affiliated with, but not a member of, the Two-Two Boys. Johnson stated that after the two groups hurried to their vehicles, they circled each other and he waited for the Lincoln to leave the WalMart parking lot. After the Lincoln turned south onto Cicero Avenue, he waited a minute and did the same. Soon thereafter, he noticed the Lincoln positioned down the road in the exit lane of a service alley of a Target store, also located on Cicero Avenue. Johnson stated that he was afraid that the Lincoln would ram the side of his Caravan if he continued to drive on Cicero, so he pulled into the alley to avoid a possible collision, bringing his van alongside the Lincoln, separated only by a low triangular median. According to Johnson, Morales then opened the rear driver’s-side door of the Lincoln, threw something at his van and got back in the Lincoln. Johnson did not know what the thrown object was but he did not think it was a gun and he did not see anyone in the Lincoln with a weapon. After his van was hit, Johnson then began to drive down the alley. He then heard two gunshots and looked over to see defendant hanging out the front passenger window of the van and facing the Lincoln with a gun in hand. Defendant came back into the van and told Johnson to “f***ing drive” and “get the f*** out of here.” Johnson left the alley and drove down 79th Street toward Harlem Avenue, when a police officer, who had just received a dispatch about the shooting, pulled him over. Defendant handed the gun to Campos and told Johnson to “keep his f***ing mouth shut” and reminded him that he knew where his fiancee lived and his sister worked. Defendant, Campos, and Cantu then jumped out of the van and fled on foot. Additional police officers arrived and Johnson was questioned but did not say anything to the police about the shooting. After Joyce Brooks was brought to the scene but failed to positively identify the van, Johnson was allowed to leave with several traffic citations. He testified that approximately one month later defendant asked him to burn the van but he refused. On September 1, 2005, officers of the Chicago police department came to Johnson’s residence as part of their investigation of the killing, at which time he told them about the shooting and directed them to the residences of defendant, Campos, and Cantu.\nCampos testified that he was a member of the Two-Two Boys, as was everyone else in the van on the day of the shooting. He stated, in relevant part, that when Johnson pulled alongside the Lincoln in the service alley, he saw Morales jump out of the Lincoln and throw a bottle, or something similar, at the van. When the object struck the van, he ducked down in the rear seat, behind defendant, and could not see anything. Campos stated that as Johnson began to drive down the alley, he heard two gunshots several seconds apart, and when he looked up, he saw defendant coming back into the passenger-side window, telling Johnson to “get the f*** out of here.” As Johnson pulled away, Campos said that defendant laughed and said “that’s what those pussies get.” Campos stated that when the van was later pulled over on 79th Street, defendant handed him the gun and they both fled. Campos and defendant ran into a nearby residential yard and defendant told him to hide the gun in a pile of wood logs. Campos hid the gun and the two men parted ways. Campos testified that in a subsequent telephone conversation defendant gave him the impression that he had disposed of the gun, telling Campos not to “trip,” “I got that. Good job.” On cross-examination, Campos said that he did not actually see Morales throw something at the van because he was already ducked down in fear that Morales was shooting at them. On redirect examination, however, he stated that he saw Morales throw something at the van.\nCantu, who was in the back of the van with Campos, testified, in relevant part, that he told Johnson to pull into the service alley alongside the Lincoln. He stated that he saw Morales jump out of the Lincoln, but he then ducked down and did not see Morales throw anything. Cantu was impeached with a sworn statement he gave to the police and with his grand jury testimony, in which he stated that he saw Morales throw something at the van. Cantu further testified that as Johnson pulled away, he saw the Lincoln turn around, at which point Johnson slowed down and defendant leaned out the window and fired a gun once or twice in the direction of the Lincoln. He stated that defendant had his shirt pulled over the bottom half of his face. He also stated that he never saw anyone in the Lincoln with a weapon. Cantu confirmed that when Johnson was later pulled over by the police, defendant handed Campos the gun before fleeing. He stated that he also ran from the police because of the shooting and because he was carrying marijuana. Cantu denied later speaking to defendant about the shooting, but was again impeached with his sworn statement, in which he stated that defendant told him to “just forget about it” and “[y]ou don’t know nothing.” On cross-examination, Cantu agreed with defense counsel that he saw a metal object in Morales’s hand as he jumped out of the Lincoln, that he thought it was a gun, that he thought Morales was shooting at the van, and that after Johnson began to drive down the alley he thought the Lincoln turned to come after them.\nMorales testified that he was previously a member of the Satan’s Disciples gang, a rival of the Two-Two Boys. He stated that he and several of his friends went to Wal-Mart on July 31, 2005, to buy spray paint. While at Wal-Mart, they saw defendant’s group and exchanged threatening looks for several minutes. They left the store soon after defendant’s group, hurried to their vehicle and left the parking lot, turning south on Cicero Avenue. Morales said that before they pulled out of the parking lot, he saw defendant in the van with his shirt pulled up to cover the bottom half of his face. He testified that they were immediately caught in traffic on Cicero Avenue and pulled into the service alley to turn around when Johnson’s van pulled up next to them. Morales said that he then stepped out of the Lincoln and threw a spray paint can at the van. The van began to drive down the alley as Jaime turned around and into the alley entrance lane. Defendant was ducking down, but he said that he could see someone with a t-shirt pulled over his face leaning out of the front passenger window of the van. Morales did not see defendant fire the gun, but he heard three gunshots. He stated that after the gunshots Jaime immediately pulled out of the alley and drove away.\nJaime testified that he is a member of the Party People gang, a rival of the Two-Two Boys. His testimony largely tracked that of Morales. Jaime stated that he was driving the Lincoln, and after leaving Wal-Mart, he mistakenly turned south onto Cicero Avenue and pulled into the service alley to turn around. Johnson’s van then pulled along side his Lincoln, Morales jumped out and threw the paint can, and the van began to drive down the alley. Jaime stated that he then turned his car around to face the van. Although he initially testified that he did so without the intention of ramming the van, he later admitted that he planned on ramming it if its occupants did anything he perceived to be more threatening. He then saw someone with a partially covered face lean out the front passenger-side window with a gun and shoot at him. Jaime heard two gunshots and immediately turned the car around and drove away.\nThe State presented a number of other witnesses, including police officers and forensic scientists and investigators. They testified, in relevant part, that a spray paint can and two cartridge cases fired from a semiautomatic weapon were recovered at the scene of the shooting. The medical examiner determined that Bonita McConnell was killed by a gunshot wound to the left side of her head. Defendant did not challenge the State’s forensic evidence, which established, inter alia, that the two cartridge cases were fired from the same 9-millimeter weapon and that Morales’s fingerprints were found on the lid of the spray paint can.\nTestifying on his own behalf, defendant admitted that he killed Bonita McConnell, although he stated that he did not know it until Cantu told him a week later. Defendant testified that before entering the alley, Campos handed him the gun that killed McConnell. He stated that when Johnson drove into the alley he saw an object that he believed to be a handgun in Morales’s hand, and when he heard something hit the van, he believed Morales was shooting at them. Defendant stated that at the time of the shooting he was afraid for his life and the lives of his friends. He said that he fired the gun to scare off the men in the Lincoln and he did not intend to hurt or kill anyone. He further said that he shot the gun with his weak hand, did not aim, intended to fire only once, and shot up and to the side of the Lincoln. Defendant denied saying “that’s what those pussies get,” denied threatening Johnson, denied asking Johnson to burn the van, and denied disposing of the gun after hiding it in the pile of wood logs. Defendant also recounted an incident that occurred in November 2004 when he was shot and a fellow gang member was killed by an unidentified assailant. Defendant stated that this incident contributed to his feeling that his life was in danger on July 31, 2005. On cross-examination, defendant conceded that he shot in the direction of Cicero Avenue.\nOn June 11, 2007, although the trial court allowed a second degree murder and involuntary manslaughter instruction, the jury returned a general verdict finding defendant guilty of the first degree murder of Bonita McConnell. Defendant’s motion for a new trial was denied and he was sentenced to 47 years of imprisonment. This appeal followed.\nANALYSIS\nI. The State Met Its Burden for First Degree Murder\nDefendant first claims the State failed to prove him guilty of first degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt.\n“When a defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence, a criminal conviction will not be set aside unless the evidence is so improbable or unsatisfactory that it creates reasonable doubt of defendant’s guilt. [Citation.] It is not within the purview of the reviewing court to retry a defendant where the sufficiency of the evidence is at issue. [Citation.] Rather, it is the responsibility of the trier of fact to determine the credibility of witnesses, the weight to be given to their testimony and the reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence. [Citation.] The relevant question on review is whether, after considering the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt. [Citation.]” People v. Rodriguez, 336 Ill. App. 3d 1, 14-15 (2002).\n“[T]he reviewing court must allow all reasonable inferences from the record in favor of the prosecution.” People v. Cunningham, 212 Ill. 2d 274, 280 (2004).\nDefendant maintains that his conviction should be reduced to the lesser offense of involuntary manslaughter because the evidence below established only reckless conduct. The State responds that there is no question defendant killed Bonita McConnell and the evidence sufficiently establishes that he did so with the requisite mental state for a first degree murder conviction.\n“A person who kills an individual without lawful justification commits first degree murder if, in performing the acts which cause the death:\n(1) he either intends to kill or do great bodily harm to that individual or another, or knows that such acts will cause death to that individual or another; or\n(2) he knows that such acts create a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to that individual or another; or\n(3) he is attempting or committing a forcible felony other than second degree murder.” 720 ILCS 5/9—1(a) (West 2008).\n“A person intends, or acts intentionally or with intent, to accomplish a result or engage in conduct described by the statute defining the offense, when his conscious objective or purpose is to accomplish that result or engage in that conduct.” 720 ILCS 5/4—4 (West 2008). “A person knows, or acts knowingly or with knowledge of *** [t]he result of his or her conduct, described by the statute defining the offense, when he or she is consciously aware that such result is practically certain to be caused by his conduct.” 720 ILCS 5/4—5 (West 2008). “Determination of defendant’s mental state may be inferred from circumstantial evidence, and this task is particularly suited to the jury.” People v. Moore, 358 Ill. App. 3d 683, 688 (2005).\n•1 Here, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, a rational trier of fact could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant intended to kill or do great bodily harm to another or that he knew his acts created a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to another. It is undisputed that defendant killed Bonita McConnell. His intent to kill can be inferred from the act of firing two bullets in the direction of an occupied car and a crowded street (People v. Smith, 258 Ill. App. 3d 1003, 1027 (1994) (“[t]he intent to murder can be inferred from the act of firing a gun at a person because the natural tendency of such an act is to destroy another’s life”)), and his words and conduct after the shooting. The fact that defendant killed Bonita McConnell, instead of one of the occupants of the Lincoln, does not mean that he acted without the requisite intent. “Under the doctrine of transferred intent, if a defendant shoots at one person[ ] with the intent to kill, but kills an unintended victim, he may be convicted of the crime of murder for the death of the unintended victim.” People v. Thompson, 313 Ill. App. 3d 510, 516 (2000). Alternatively, it is not unreasonable to conclude that defendant knew that his actions were practically certain to result in the death or substantial injury of another. See People v. Lake, 298 Ill. App. 3d 50, 54 (1998) (“Intentionally firing a weapon at an occupied building is an act that has a natural tendency to cause death or great bodily harm and is of such a character as to defeat any assertion of recklessness.”); accord People v. Mimms, 312 Ill. App. 3d 226, 231 (2000) (defendant presumed to know that firing a gun at an occupied home created a strong probability of death or great bodily harm to the occupants of that home).\nAlthough defendant argues that his testimony established that he fired up and away from the Lincoln and that he did not intend to kill or injure anyone, the jury’s apparent decision to disregard his account was not unreasonable in light of the other witnesses’ statements and the physical evidence. For example, the death of Bonita McConnell, who was driving behind and perpendicular to the Lincoln, can support the conclusion that defendant did not fire up and away from the Lincoln and Cicero Avenue; a conclusion also supported by the testimony of Johnson and Jaime. Further, the fact that defendant had the gun and pulled his shirt over his face before entering the alley strongly suggests that he intended to do harm. It was not unreasonable for the jury to conclude that defendant fired at the Lincoln with the intent to kill or cause great bodily harm to its occupants, or that he acted with the knowledge that doing so was practically certain to result in the death or substantial injury of another.\nIn reaching this conclusion, the court rejects defendant’s assertion that this case is analogous to People v. Andersch, 107 Ill. App. 3d 810 (1982), and People v. Hoover, 250 Ill. App. 3d 338 (1993), both of which stated that pointing a loaded gun at another can constitute recklessness. Andersch and Hoover involved defendants who accidentally discharged their weapons. Here, defendant did not accidentally fire his weapon. Defendant’s argument that Andersch and Hoover are controlling because in those cases the “defendants consciously disregarded the substantial risks in pointing a loaded gun at another person, just as Garcia consciously disregarded the substantial risks presented by firing the gun in the direction of the Lincoln and Cicero Avenue,” is unconvincing. Given the facts presented at trial, it was reasonable for the jury to conclude that defendant intentionally fired his weapon at the Lincoln in the direction of Cicero Avenue and that he did so with the intent or knowledge required of first degree murder.\nII. Second Degree Murder Is Not Warranted\n•2 Defendant contends, alternatively, that we should reduce his conviction to second degree murder because the evidence establishes that he acted under an unreasonable belief that the use of deadly force was justified. A second degree murder conviction is appropriate where, inter alia, “at the time of the killing [the defendant] believes the circumstances to be such that, if they existed, would justify or exonerate the killing under the principles stated in Article 7 of this Code [(720 ILCS 5/7—1 et seq. (West 2008))], but his or her belief [was] unreasonable.” 720 ILCS 5/9—2(a)(2) (West 2008). Defendant bears the burden of proving this mitigating factor by a preponderance of the evidence. 720 ILCS 5/9—2(c) (West 2008). In other words, “[o]nce the State has proven first-degree murder beyond a reasonable doubt, the defendant must prove by a preponderance of the evidence *** that he believed that the circumstances justified using self-defense, but that his belief was unreasonable.” People v. Hawkins, 296 Ill. App. 3d 830, 836 (1998).\n“To establish self-defense, the defendant must show some evidence that unlawful force was threatened against him; the danger of harm was imminent; he was not the aggressor; that he actually believed that a danger existed, force was necessary to avert the danger, and the type and amount of force was necessary; and that his beliefs were reasonable. [Citations.] While the law does not require the aggressor to be armed for self-defense to be justified, it must appear that the aggressor is capable of inflicting serious bodily harm without the use of a deadly weapon, and is intending to do so. [Citations.]” Id. at 837.\nDefendant maintains that because the evidence established that he had an actual, albeit unreasonable, belief in the necessity of using deadly force in self-defense, the trial court erred in not reducing his conviction to second degree murder. The State responds that there was ample evidence to support the conclusion that defendant did not believe his actions were necessary to protect his life and, therefore, that he was not acting in self-defense. We agree.\n“Wfliether a killing is justified under the law of self-defense is a question of fact [citations], and the fact finder is not required to accept as true the defendant’s evidence in support of that defense [citations]. Instead, the trier of fact is obliged to consider the probability or improbability of the evidence, the circumstances sur rounding the event, and all of the witnesses’ testimony. [Citations.]” People v. Huddleston, 243 Ill. App. 3d 1012, 1018-19 (1993).\nIn the case sub judice, defendant offered some evidence that he was acting in self-defense. The occupants of both vehicles confirmed that they belonged to rival gangs, that the groups exchanged menacing looks at the Wal-Mart, that Morales jumped out of the Lincoln with something in his hand when Johnson’s van drove into the alley, that something then hit the van, and that the Lincoln turned to face the van as the latter drove away. However, the State supplied testimony rebutting defendant’s self-defense claim. For instance, the State introduced uncontradicted testimony that defendant had a gun and pulled his shirt over his face before entering the alley and that Johnson was driving away when defendant shot at the Lincoln. The State also introduced testimony that after firing the gun at the Lincoln, defendant laughed and said “that’s what those pussies get,” then fled from the police, told his friends to keep quiet about the incident, and destroyed or tried to destroy evidence. None of this behavior suggests self-defense. Given this testimony, it was reasonable for the jury to disregard defendant’s testimony and conclude that defendant was the aggressor. We therefore affirm defendant’s first degree murder conviction.\nIII. The State’s Opening, Closing and Rebuttal Remarks Did Not Constitute Plain Error and Defendant Forfeited Any Objection to Those Remarks on Appeal\n•3 Finally, defendant argues that he was denied a fair trial because the State made prejudicial remarks during its opening statement and closing and rebuttal arguments. The State responds that defendant waived any challenge to the remarks made at trial by his failure to preserve his objections. “In order to preserve an issue for review, the general rule is that a defendant must both object at trial and file a written post-trial motion raising the issue.” People v. Anderson, 250 Ill. App. 3d 439, 451 (1993). Defendant does not contest that he failed to properly preserve his objections by objecting to the State’s comments at trial and raising those objections in his posttrial motion. Instead, he asserts that the State’s remarks constitute plain error and therefore avoid the general forfeiture rule. We disagree.\n“Plain error is a narrow and limited exception to the general waiver rule.” People v. Pastorino, 91 Ill. 2d 178, 188 (1982).\n“[T]he plain-error doctrine allows a reviewing court to consider unpreserved error when (1) a clear or obvious error occurred and the evidence is so closely balanced that the error alone threatened to tip the scales of justice against the defendant, regardless of the seriousness of the error, or (2) a clear or obvious error occurred and that error is so serious that it affected the fairness of the defendant’s trial and challenged the integrity of the judicial process, regardless of the closeness of the evidence.” People v. Piatkowski, 225 Ill. 2d 551, 565 (2007).\nThe first prong of this test applies “where the evidence in a case is so closely balanced that the jury’s guilty verdict may have resulted from the error and not the evidence.” People v. Herron, 215 Ill. 2d 167, 178 (2005). With regard to the second prong, “plain error review is equated with structural error.” People v. Brazziel, 406 Ill. App. 3d 412, 427 (2010).\n“An error is typically designated as ‘structural’ and requiring automatic reversal only if it necessarily renders a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or unreliable in determining guilt or innocence. [Citation.] The Supreme Court has held an error is structural only in a ‘very limited class of cases.’ [Citation.] Structural errors include a complete denial of counsel, denial of self-representation at trial, trial before a biased judge, denial of a public trial, racial discrimination in the selection of a grand jury, and a defective reasonable doubt instruction. [Citation.]” People v. Averett, 237 Ill. 2d 1, 12-13 (2010).\nUnder both prongs “the burden of persuasion remains with the defendant.” Herron, 215 Ill. 2d at 187. The court will consider each of the complained-of statements in turn.\nIn its opening statement, the State said that Bonita McConnell’s death was “a result of nonsense that occurs in our streets, nonsense that has to stop, nonsense that stops with your verdict, nonsense that will stop when you come back with a verdict for the offense of first degree murder.” Defendant argues that this statement was designed to appeal to the jury’s prejudices and constituted plain error.\n“The purpose of an opening statement is to apprise the jury of what each party expects the evidence to prove. [Citation.] An opening statement may include a discussion of the expected evidence and reasonable inferences from the evidence. [Citations.] No statement may be made in opening which counsel does not intend to prove or cannot prove. [Citation.] *** Reversible error occurs only where the prosecutor’s opening comments are attributable to deliberate misconduct of the prosecutor and result in substantial prejudice to the defendant. [Citation.]” (Emphasis in original.) People v. Kliner, 185 Ill. 2d 81, 127 (1998).\nAlthough argumentative comments are generally improper in opening statements, the evidence in this case was not closely balanced such that the State’s comments threatened to tip the balance against defendant. Defendant admitted that he killed Bonita McConnell, and for the reasons stated above, we do not believe that the evidence regarding his self-defense claim was close. Nor is the error complained of structural. We find that the State’s opening remarks did not constitute plain error and defendant forfeited his objection to them.\nThe same can be said of the State’s comments in its closing and rebuttal arguments, in which it referred to defendant’s self-defense theory as “ridiculous” and “insulting,” and referenced any second degree murder conviction as “a travesty” of justice. Defendant argues that in making these statements, the State improperly ridiculed his theory of the case and suggested that the defense was lying and hiding the truth. Defendant also complains of statements made by the State in its rebuttal urging that the jury do, and that Bonita McConnell and her family deserve, justice.\n“It is well settled that great latitude is afforded a prosecutor during closing argument [citation], and that the propriety of the prosecution’s remarks is generally left to the discretion of the trial court ***. In closing argument, the prosecution may base its argument on the evidence presented or reasonable inferences therefrom [citation]; respond to those comments by defense counsel which clearly invite or provoke a response [citation]; comment on the credibility of the defense witnesses [citation]; denounce the activities of defendants and urge that justice be administered [citation]; highlight inconsistencies in defendant’s argument [citation]; and comment on defendant’s absence at trial [citation].” People v. Morrison, 137 Ill. App. 3d 171, 184 (1985).\nIn the instant case, we have carefully reviewed the closing and rebuttal arguments, paying particular attention to the remarks of which defendant complains, and conclude that the State’s comments do not constitute plain error. The remarks were either within the bounds of a proper closing or rebuttal argument or, if improper, cannot be said to have impacted the jury’s decision in light of the evidence of defendant’s guilt. See People v. Gray, 252 Ill. App. 3d 362, 368-69 (1993) (prosecutor’s characterization of defendant’s theory of the case as “so ridiculous that it isn’t even worthy of comment” not reversible error); People v. Belvedere, 72 Ill. App. 3d 998, 1020 (1979) (prosecutor’s exhortation to jury not to “cop-out” by returning voluntary manslaughter verdict based on defendant’s testimony not reversible error because it concerned defendant’s credibility). This is especially true in light of the trial court’s detailed jury instructions, in which it stated, inter alia, that “[n] either opening statements nor closing arguments are evidence and any statement or arguments made by the attorney which is not based on the evidence should be disregarded.” The State’s remarks did not constitute plain error; therefore, defendant forfeited any objection to those remarks on appeal.\nCONCLUSION\nFor all the foregoing reasons, we affirm defendant’s conviction for first degree murder.\nAffirmed.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}]
[{&#39;author&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE CONNORS&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE CONNORS\ndelivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\nPresiding Justice Cunningham and Justice Karnezis concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nOPINION\nThis appeal arises from plaintiff United Automobile Insurance Company’s attempt to vacate an arbitration award that was entered in favor of defendants Sidney Wilson and Woodrow Wilson. The circuit court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiff’s complaint pursuant to section 2—619(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2—619(a) (West 2008)). We affirm.\nBACKGROUND\nDefendants were involved in a hit-and-run car accident on February 2, 2004, and they subsequently filed a claim under the uninsured motorist provision of their auto insurance policy, which had been issued by plaintiff. However, the vehicle was later stolen before plaintiff could inspect it for purposes of evaluating the claim. Although the vehicle was later recovered, it was junked prior to being inspected.\nOn January 27, 2005, plaintiff filed a declaratory judgment action in the circuit court of Cook County, which asked the circuit court to find that defendants’ claim was not covered under the policy and that the policy was void due to defendants’ alleged spoliation of evidence. However, the insurance policy contained an arbitration provision, as required by section 143a(1) of the Illinois Insurance Code (215 ILCS 5/143a(1) (West 2002)). Plaintiff moved to stay arbitration pending resolution of the declaratory judgment action. The circuit court denied plaintiff’s motion to stay and ordered that the parties proceed to arbitration on all issues, notably including the issue of coverage.\nPlaintiff appealed the trial court’s order declining to stay arbitration, and we reversed. See United Automobile Insurance Co. v. Wilson, No. 1—05—0372 (Mar. 16, 2005) (unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23). We found that the circuit court had erred by ordering the parties into arbitration before deciding whether the policy covered the 2004 accident. We noted that this issue is controlled by State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co. v. Yapejian, 152 Ill. 2d 533 (1992), which held that arbitration under section 143a(1) is limited to only “disputes concerning covered claims, once coverage was established.” Id. at 541. Under Yapejian, whether or not coverage exists is an issue for the circuit court to determine. Once the circuit court finds that a particular claim is covered, section 143a(1) mandates that any disputes over that claim be arbitrated. We consequently reversed and remanded “with instructions to stay arbitration pending resolution of the coverage issues by the trial court.” United Automobile Insurance Co., slip op. at 4.\nPlaintiff did not move for a stay of the arbitration during the appeal, and while the appeal was pending, the arbitration had commenced. The arbitrator heard evidence on all issues, including coverage, but the arbitrator had not issued a ruling by the time we resolved the appeal. After receiving our mandate, the circuit court stayed arbitration and proceeded to a bench trial on the coverage issue.\nOn February 1, 2007, the circuit court issued a written memorandum opinion and order. The circuit court found that no spoliation of evidence had occurred and that the uninsured motorist provision of the insurance policy covered the 2004 accident. Having found that coverage existed, the circuit court compelled arbitration on the remaining disputes. Plaintiff appealed the circuit court’s ruling, and we affirmed. See United Automobile Insurance Co. v. Wilson, No. 1—07—0424 (Sept. 4, 2007) (unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23).\nHowever, plaintiff again did not obtain a stay of arbitration pending appeal, so arbitration resumed after trial. On May 24, 2007, the arbitrator issued an award in favor of defendants in the amount of $11,000 to Woodrow Wilson and $9,000 to Sidney Wilson. Six days later, on May 30, 2007, plaintiff filed the instant declaratory judgment action in the circuit court of Cook County seeking to vacate the arbitration award. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted on October 13, 2009. The circuit court subsequently confirmed the arbitration award and entered judgment in favor of defendants on October 29, 2009. Plaintiff timely appealed, and this case is now before us for the third time.\nANALYSIS\nPlaintiffs brief on appeal leaves a great deal to be desired in terms of clarity of argument and legal support. Despite the briefs convoluted drafting and sparse legal citation, we perceive that plaintiffs primary argument is that the arbitration award is void because arbitration commenced before the circuit court determined the issue of coverage.\nWe review an order of dismissal under section 2 — 619(a) of the Code of Civil Procedure de novo, accepting as true all well-pled facts contained in the complaint and in any uncontradicted affidavits attached to the motion. See Coady v. Harpo, Inc., 308 Ill. App. 3d 153, 158-59 (1999). The question on review is “ ‘whether the existence of a genuine issue of material fact should have precluded the dismissal or, absent such an issue of fact, whether dismissal is proper as a matter of law.’ ” Doyle v. Holy Cross Hospital, 186 Ill. 2d 104, 110 (1999) (quoting Kedzie &amp; 103rd Currency Exchange, Inc. v. Hodge, 156 Ill. 2d 112, 116-17 (1993)).\n•1 Judicial review of a binding arbitration award is more limited than review of a decision of the trial court (Rauh v. Rockford Products Corp., 143 Ill. 2d 377, 394 (1991)), and we will construe an award so as to uphold it whenever possible (Garver v. Ferguson, 76 Ill. 2d 1, 10 (1979)). Under section 143a of the Illinois Insurance Code, “[a]ny decision made by the arbitrators shall be binding for the amount of damages not exceeding $50,000 for bodily injury to or death of any one person, $100,000 for bodily injury to or death of 2 or more persons in any one motor vehicle accident, or the corresponding policy limits for bodily injury or death, whichever is less.” 215 ILCS 5/143a (West 2008). A binding arbitration award under section 143a is subject to only limited judicial review under section 12 of the Uniform Arbitration Act (710 ILCS 5/12 (West 2008)). See Reed v. Farmers Insurance Croup, 188 Ill. 2d 168, 172 (1999).\n•2 Because the total arbitration award in favor of both defendants was only $20,000, it is binding and subject to only limited judicial review. Under the Uniform Arbitration Act, a binding award may only be vacated where\n“(1) The award was procured by corruption, fraud or other undue means;\n(2) There was evident partiality by an arbitrator appointed as a neutral or corruption in any one of the arbitrators or misconduct prejudicing the rights of any party;\n(3) The arbitrators exceeded their powers;\n(4) The arbitrators refused to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause being shown therefor or refused to hear evidence material to the controversy or otherwise so conducted the hearing, contrary to the provisions of Section 5 [(710 ILCS 5/5 (West 2008))], as to prejudice substantially the rights of a party; or\n(5) There was no arbitration agreement and the issue was not adversely determined in proceedings under Section 2 [(710 ILCS 5/2 (West 2008))] and the party did not participate in the arbitration hearing without raising the objection; but the fact that the relief was such that it could not or would not be granted by the circuit court is not ground for vacating or refusing to confirm the award.” 710 ILCS 5/12 (West 2008).\nIllinois case law has also established that an award may be vacated “if it results in the contravention of a paramount consideration of public policy [citation], where a gross error of law or fact appears on the face of the award [citation], or where the award fails to dispose of all matters properly submitted to the arbitrators [citation].” Edward Electric Co. v. Automation, Inc., 229 Ill. App. 3d 89, 97-98 (1992).\nIn its brief on appeal plaintiff repeatedly asserts that the award was “void ab initio” because arbitration proceedings commenced before the circuit court determined the coverage issue. It appears that plaintiff intends to base its argument on section 12(a)(3) of the Uniform Arbitration Act (710 ILCS 5/12(a)(3) (West 2008)), on the ground that the arbitrator exceeded his authority by hearing evidence before coverage was determined by the circuit court.\n•3 We presume that arbitrators act within their authority, and the scope of an arbitrator’s powers is expressed by the arbitration agreement. See Rauh v. Rockford Products Corp., 143 Ill. 2d 377 (1991). However, plaintiff does not appear to have included a copy of the insurance policy or relevant arbitration clause in the record, nor has plaintiff directed our attention to where it might be found if it exists. It is the appellant’s burden to provide a complete record for the appeal. See Altafv. Hanover Square Condominium Ass’n No. 1, 188 Ill. App. 3d 533, 539 (1989); see also Mielke v. Condell Memorial Hospital, 124 Ill. App. 3d 42, 48-49 (1984) (noting that we are “not obligated to search the record for evidence supporting reversal of the trial court”); Ill. S. Ct. R 341(h)(7) (eff. July 1, 2008). Absent a complete record, “[a]ny doubts which may arise from the incompleteness of the record will be resolved against the appellant.” Foutch v. O’Bryant, 99 Ill. 2d 389, 392 (1984). Because the arbitration agreement does not appear to be part of the record, we must presume that the arbitrator acted within the scope of his powers when issuing the award.\n•4 To the extent that plaintiff asserts that our reversal of the circuit court’s arbitration order voided all later arbitration proceedings and any award based on them, we reject this contention. Our mandate to the circuit court in that order was “to stay arbitration pending resolution of the coverage issues by the trial court.” (Emphasis added.) United Automobile Insurance Co. v. Wilson, No. 1—05—0372, slip op. at 4 (Mar. 16, 2005) (unpublished order under Supreme Court Rule 23). We did not vacate any portion of the arbitration proceedings that had occurred prior to that point, but rather ordered that the proceedings be stayed until the coverage issue had been resolved. A stay does not vacate anything, but it is instead only the “postponement or halting of a proceeding, judgment, or the like.” Black’s Law Dictionary 1425 (7th ed. 1999); cf. 7-Eleven, Inc. v. Dar, 363 Ill. App. 3d 41, 45 (2005) (“The substantive effect of our order vacating the entire arbitration award was to restore the parties to their original status in the case, i.e., as though the arbitration award had never been entered.”). Plaintiff misreads the plain meaning of our order, and its reliance on that decision in support of vacating the arbitration award is misplaced.\nMoreover, the only case that plaintiff cites in support of this argument is Yapejian, which held merely that the issue of coverage is not subject to arbitration. See Yapejian, 152 Ill. 2d at 541. Yapejian did not hold that arbitration proceedings may not begin before the coverage issue is determined. Regardless of whether the arbitrator may have heard evidence on the coverage issue, the record is clear that he did not decide whether coverage existed. Yapejian consequently has no bearing on the question of whether the award should be vacated.\n•5 There is no indication in the record before us that the arbitrator exceeded his authority, and therefore any argument that the award should be vacated on that ground fails. Plaintiff does not raise on appeal any additional basis to vacate the award, and we therefore affirm the orders of the circuit court dismissing the complaint and confirming the arbitration award.\nWe note that plaintiff asks in its brief that if we find that the award should be vacated, then we should order that the arbitrator be replaced on remand due to alleged bias against plaintiff. Because plaintiff has not raised this issue as a reason to vacate the award and we find that the award should be confirmed, we do not reach this argument. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 341(h)(7) (eff. July 1, 2008) (“Points not argued are waived and shall not be raised in the reply brief, in oral argument, or on petition for rehearing.”).\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court dismissing the complaint and confirming the arbitration award is affirmed.\nAffirmed.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}]

The action was dismissed with regard to Clayton, but the circuit court granted a summary judgment in favor of plaintiff and denied State Farm’s motion for a summary judgment. State Farm now appeals, arguing the trial court erred in granting a summary judgment in favor of plaintiff. We affirm.\nFACTS\nClayton’s home, located at 2101 Jerome Lane in Cahokia, was insured by State Farm. On August 23, 2008, a fire destroyed her home, prompting Clayton to file a claim with State Farm. Clayton hired plaintiff to assist her in adjusting her claim. Clayton and plaintiff entered into a contract dated August 25, 2008. The contract states as follows:\n“I [Clayton] hereby authorize Golub and Associates to assist me in the adjustment of my fire loss with the insurance companies insuring my property at 2101 Jerome Lane, Cahokia, IL, and which occurred on 8-23-08, for which I agree to pay them on the receipt of my drafts in payment of said loss the sum equal to 10% of the amount of the adjustment. I, hereby, assign to them all money becoming due to the extent of the fee for adjusting said loss. It is understood that no settlement is to be made without my approval.”\nAce Hart, an agent employed by plaintiff, signed on behalf of plaintiff.\nOn August 26, 2008, Hart notified State Farm by facsimile and regular mail of plaintiff’s contract with Clayton and plaintiffs lien on the insurance proceeds and asked that plaintiffs name be included on any payments made to Clayton. Plaintiff negotiated a settlement with State Farm to Clayton in the amount of $72,076.58. Initially, State Farm issued a check to both plaintiff and Clayton.\nOn November 14, 2008, Clayton gave oral notice to State Farm that she was terminating her contract with plaintiff and requested that plaintiff not be named on any checks State Farm paid to her. On November 21, 2008, Clayton gave written notice to State Farm that she terminated her contract with plaintiff. Thereafter, State Farm complied with Clayton’s request not to include plaintiff as a payee and reissued a check with only Clayton as a payee.\nOn February 26, 2009, plaintiff filed suit against Clayton and State Farm. Count I was directed against Clayton and alleged that she breached her contract with plaintiff. Count II was directed against State Farm and alleged that State Farm was liable for plaintiff’s claimed fees because plaintiff had a lien on Clayton’s insurance proceeds which State Farm failed to honor. Plaintiff and State Farm filed cross-motions for a summary judgment on count II. On July 31, 2009, the trial court granted a summary judgment in favor of plaintiff and entered a judgment against State Farm in the amount of $7,562.85. State Farm now appeals.\nANALYSIS\nState Farm argues that the trial court erred in granting a summary judgment in favor of plaintiff. State Farm first contends that plaintiff did not have a valid lien on Clayton’s insurance proceeds because the Illinois Insurance Code (215 ILCS 5/1 et seq. (West 2008)) does not create a statutory lien in favor of public adjusters and State Farm’s only duty was to its insured. Plaintiff replies that its contract with Clayton was an adequate basis for a lien and that section 512.52 of the Illinois Insurance Code (215 ILCS 5/512.52 (West 2008)) provides the proper statutory authority for the lien. We agree with plaintiff.\nSection 512.52 of the Illinois Insurance Code is a definitions section that provides in pertinent part as follows:\n“(a) ‘Adjusting insurance claims’ means representing an insured with an insurer for compensation[ ] and while representing that insured either negotiating values, damages, or depreciation[ ] or applying the loss circumstances to insurance policy provisions.\n(b) ‘Public Insurance Adjuster’ means a person engaged in the business of adjusting insurance claims who is licensed pursuant to this Article.\n***\n(d) ‘Compensation’ shall include, but need not be limited to, the following:\n1. any assignment of insurance proceeds or a percentage thereof;\n2. any agreement to make repairs for the amount of the insurance proceeds payable;\n3. assertion of any lien against insurance proceeds payable.” (Emphasis added.) 215 ILCS 5/512.52(a), (b), (d) (West 2008).\nWe agree with plaintiff that our General Assembly’s choice of the word “lien” in the statute indicates its intention to make a lien enforceable against payments which have not yet occurred.\nThe instant situation presents a classic case in which a party who has been provided a service attempts to hustle the provider out of its fee. Here, plaintiff adjusted the claim on behalf of Clayton against State Farm; however, once the claim was adjusted, Clayton attempted to “fire” plaintiff. We agree with plaintiff that no one should be expected to work in a profession that would allow clients to fire the professional after the professional’s services were rendered unless there is an avenue to ensure payment. By specifically using the term “lien,” our General Assembly ensured that public insurance adjusters would be safeguarded against the type of situation presented here.\nThe contract specifically authorized plaintiff to assist Clayton in the adjustment of her fire loss that occurred on August 23, 2008. In exchange for plaintiffs services, Clayton agreed to pay plaintiff “10% of the amount of the adjustment.” Clayton assigned to plaintiff “all money becoming due to the extent of the fee for adjusting said loss.” Plaintiff gave notice to State Farm of its contract with Clayton.\nPlaintiff then went about assessing the value of Clayton’s fire-damaged property, contacted contractors, and negotiated a settlement with State Farm on Clayton’s behalf in the amount of $72,076.58. Shortly after the settlement was negotiated, Clayton “fired” plaintiff. Clayton refused to pay and asked State Farm to issue a new check. State Farm originally recognized the lien when it issued a check to both plaintiff and Clayton, but State Farm went along with Clayton’s request and reissued a check without plaintiff’s name. Here, the contract signed by Clayton created the lien, and State Farm should have honored the lien.\nWe are aware that chapter 770 of the Illinois Compiled Statutes creates lien rights in favor of numerous occupations and professions, such as attorneys (770 ILCS 5/1 (West 2008)) and health care professions, including physicians and dentists (770 ILCS 23/10 (West 2008)), but fails to specifically discuss liens with regard to public insurance adjusters. However, nowhere in chapter 770 does it state that these are the only liens that can be recognized. Chapter 770 is not meant to be comprehensive, and thus, we disagree with State Farm’s assertion that because chapter 770 of the Illinois Compiled Statutes fails to specifically set forth that public insurance adjusters shall have a lien, no such lien can exist.\nHeritage/Pullman Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co., 104 Ill. App. 3d 1058, 433 N.E.2d 1034 (1982), supports our holding that a lien was created here. In that case, the owner of a shopping center retained a public insurance adjuster to assist in its claim with State Farm involving a collapsed roof. As in the instant case, a contract was entered into in which the insured owner of the shopping center agreed to pay the public insurance adjuster 10% of the amount of the agreed-upon loss. Heritage/Pullman Bank &amp; Trust Co., 104 Ill. App. 3d at 1059, 433 N.E.2d at 1035. The adjuster negotiated with State Farm, which offered to pay $75,062 on the claim. The insured owner refused the offer on the basis that it was unsatisfactory and thereafter retained an attorney who eventually negotiated a settlement in the amount of $137,976 in partial payment on the claim.\nThe public insurance adjuster then placed a lien on the owner’s recovery, preventing the owner from endorsing the draft. Litigation ensued. Ultimately, the trial court refused to remove the lien and ordered the owner to pay $15,412, the total amount of the adjuster’s lien. Heritage/Pullman Bank &amp; Trust Co., 104 Ill. App. 3d at 1059, 433 N.E.2d at 1035. Our colleagues in the First District remanded on the issue of the sufficiency of the public adjuster’s work but never disputed the validity of the lien, specifically stating as follows:\n“Where parties by their own contract create a duty, they must abide by the contract and make the promise good. [Citation.] We hold that the second amended complaint states a cause of action because it alleges that [the public insurance adjuster] never performed the services which entitled it to compensation. If this allegation could be proved, then plaintiffs would be entitled to the relief prayed for in their petition.” Heritage/Pullman Bank &amp; Trust Co., 104 Ill. App. 3d at 1060, 433 N.E.2d at 1035-36.\nIn the instant case, Clayton agreed to pay 10% of the amount of the agreed-upon loss to plaintiff for assisting in the adjustment of Clayton’s claim, thereby creating a common law hen that must be paid.\nState Farm’s assertion that it was not a party to the contract between plaintiff and Clayton and cannot be bound by any provision thereunder is unconvincing. Public insurance adjusters commonly assert liens on insurance proceeds that are honored by insurance companies. See Lake Shore Racquet Club, Inc. v. Fireman’s Fund Insurance Cos., 91 Ill. App. 3d 1118, 415 N.E.2d 625 (1980). Here, plaintiff performed the work and negotiated a settlement with State Farm. Plaintiff is entitled to be compensated for its work per the terms of its contract with Clayton. State Farm initially issued a check to plaintiff but later followed Clayton’s instructions not to pay plaintiff. State Farm was wrong to go along with Clayton’s plan to deprive plaintiff of its rightfully earned fee.\nCONCLUSION\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the circuit court of St. Clair County is hereby affirmed.\nAffirmed.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}]
[{&#39;author&#39;: &#39;PRESIDING JUSTICE McCULLOUGH&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &#39;PRESIDING JUSTICE McCULLOUGH\ndelivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\nJustices Hoffman, Hudson, Holdridge and Stewart concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nOPINION\nOn March 31 and April 2, 2003, claimant, Charlotte Graham, filed applications for adjustment of claim pursuant to the Workers’ Compensation Act (Act) (820 ILCS 305/1 et seq. (West 2002)), seeking benefits from employer, United Airlines. At arbitration, the parties stipulated that claimant sustained accidental injuries that arose out of and in the course of her employment on May 9 and October 23, 2001. The only disputed issue was the nature and extent of her injuries. Following a consolidated hearing, the arbitrator awarded claimant wage differential benefits pursuant to section 8(d)(1) of the Act (820 ILCS 305/8(d)(1) (West 2002)) of (1) $417.93 per week for 13 weeks from May 13, 2005, through August 11, 2005; (2) $407.93 per week for 95/7 weeks from August 12, 2005, through May 8, 2007; and (3) $407.93 from May 9, 2007 and “continuing for the duration of the disability.”\nThe Illinois Workers’ Compensation Commission (Commission) affirmed and adopted the arbitrator’s decision. On judicial review, the circuit court of Cook County confirmed the Commission. Employer appeals, arguing (1) the word “disability” as used in section 8(d)(1) of the Act encompasses economic disability and (2) the Commission erred by sustaining claimant’s objection to evidence offered by employer regarding claimant’s work-life expectancy. We affirm.\nOn August 26, 1990, claimant began working for employer as a flight attendant. Employer agrees she sustained accidental injuries to her back that arose out of and in the course of her employment on both May 9, 2001, and October 23, 2001. Following her work-related accidents, claimant underwent extensive medical treatment, including two surgeries to her lower back. Ultimately, claimant’s treating physician placed her under permanent restrictions of no lifting of greater than 30 pounds, no pushing or pulling of greater than 40 pounds, and no repetitive bending or twisting. Employer’s medical department also determined long-term restrictions on claimant’s physical activities to be appropriate.\nAt arbitration, claimant sought wage differential benefits pursuant to section 8(d)(1) of the Act (820 ILCS 305/8(d)(1) (West 2002)). Employer attempted to introduce the testimony and a report of Dr. Arthur Eubanks, an economist, to provide an opinion on what age claimant was likely to leave the workforce. Claimant objected to Dr. Eubanks’s testimony and report, arguing it was irrelevant in a section 8(d)(1) proceeding. Employer argued the word “disability” in section 8(d)(1) referred to “economic disability” and evidence as to when claimant was likely to leave the workforce would be relevant to determining when her “economic disability” would end. The arbitrator disagreed with employer and sustained claimant’s objection to the evidence.\nOn April 8, 2009, the Commission affirmed and adopted the arbitrator’s decision without further comment. On September 24, 2009, the circuit court of Cook County confirmed the Commission.\nThis appeal followed.\nOn appeal, employer argues the Commission erred by sustaining claimant’s objection to the opinion evidence of its economist, Dr. Eu-banks, regarding the age at which claimant would retire from the workforce. It contends the clause “duration of disability” in section 8(d)(1) of the Act refers to the duration of a claimant’s impaired earning capacity and Dr. Eubanks’s opinions were relevant to a calculation of benefits under section 8(d)(1).\n“Evidentiary rulings made during the course of a workers’ compensation case will not be disturbed on review absent an abuse of discretion.” Certified Testing v. Industrial Comm’n, 367 Ill. App. 3d 938, 947, 856 N.E.2d 602, 610 (2006). However, issues involving statu tory construction are subject to de novo review. Washington District 50 Schools v. Illinois Workers’ Compensation Comm’n, 394 Ill. App. 3d 1087, 1090, 917 N.E.2d 586, 589 (2009).\n“The fundamental rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the legislature’s intent.” Beelman Trucking v. Illinois Workers’ Compensation Comm’n, 233 Ill. 2d 364, 370, 909 N.E.2d 818, 822 (2009). The best indication of legislative intent is the statutory language, given its plain and ordinary meaning. Beelman Trucking, 233 Ill. 2d at 370-71, 909 N.E.2d at 822. Other considerations include “the reason for the law, the problems to be remedied, and the objects and purposes sought.” Beelman Trucking, 233 Ill. 2d at 371, 909 N.E.2d at 822-23. “[T]he *** Act is a remedial statute intended to provide financial protection for injured workers and it is to be liberally construed to accomplish that objective.” Beelman Trucking, 233 Ill. 2d at 371, 909 N.E.2d at 823.\nSection 8(d)(1) of the Act provides as follows:\n“If, after the accidental injury has been sustained, the employee as a result thereof becomes partially incapacitated from pursuing his usual and customary line of employment, he shall *** receive compensation for the duration of his disability, subject to the limitations as to maximum amounts fixed in paragraph (b) of this Section, equal to 66⅔% of the difference between the average amount which he would be able to earn in the full performance of his duties in the occupation in which he was engaged at the time of the accident and the average amount which he is earning or is able to earn in some suitable employment or business after the accident.” (Emphasis added.) 820 ILCS 305/8(d)(1) (West 2002).\nHere the parties dispute the meaning of “disability” as used in section 8(d)(1). Claimant contends “disability” refers only to physical or mental disability, while employer maintains it also encompasses economic disability. The arbitrator and Commission rejected employer’s interpretation, relying on Petrie v. Industrial Comm’n, 160 Ill. App. 3d 165, 513 N.E.2d 104 (1987).\nIn Petrie, 160 Ill. App. 3d at 170, 513 N.E.2d at 108, this court considered “whether an increase in economic disability alone [was] a proper basis for modification of an award pursuant to section 19(h) of the Act.” We concluded “that a change in physical or mental condition is a prerequisite for a section 19(h) petition.” Petrie, 160 Ill. App. 3d at 172, 513 N.E.2d at 109. A review of the Act showed “that when the legislature used the term ‘disability’ in section 19(h) it was referring to physical and mental disability and not economic disability.” Petrie, 160 Ill. App. 3d at 171, 513 N.E.2d at 108.\n“This intent is evident by reference to the following sections: section 1(b)(3) refers to an employee’s ‘cause of action by reason of any injury, disablement or death’; section 8(d)(1) states that an injured employee who ‘becomes partially incapacitated from pursuing his usual and customary line of employment *** shall *** receive compensation for the duration of his disability’; section 8(d)(2) refers to injuries which ‘disable [the employee] from pursuing other suitable occupations’; and section 12 provides that an injured employee must submit to a physical examination on request of the employer for the purpose of determining the nature, extent, and duration of the injury and for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation due ‘for disability.’ [Citation.] On the other hand, when the legislature intended to refer to something other than physical and mental disability, it used different or additional language: sections 6(c)(1) and 8(h—1) refer to ‘legal disability’; and section 8(d)(2) refers to ‘impairment of earning capacity.’ [Citation.]” Petrie, 160 Ill. App. 3d at 171-72, 513 N.E.2d at 108-09.\nThis court relied on Petrie in Cassens Transport Co. v. Illinois Industrial Comm’n, 354 Ill. App. 3d 807, 821 N.E.2d 1274 (2005), when specifically addressing whether “disability” as used in section 8(d)(1) meant economic disability. In that case, the employer filed a motion to suspend wage differential benefits that were previously awarded to the claimant, asserting the claimant “had failed to respond to requests to provide income tax returns to determine whether a wage loss still existed.” Cassens, 354 Ill. App. 3d at 807, 821 N.E.2d at 1275. The Commission denied the motion, finding section 8(d)(1) did not refer to economic disability, only physical and mental disability. Cassens, 354 Ill. App. 3d at 807-08, 821 N.E.2d at 1275. “As there was no allegation that there was a change in [the] claimant’s physical condition, the Commission found there was no basis for suspending payments.” Cassens, 354 Ill. App. 3d at 808, 821 N.E.2d at 1275.\nOn review, we determined that neither the Commission nor this court had jurisdiction in the case, stating section 8(d)(1) was not one of the select provisions of the Act that permitted the Commission to reopen or modify a final decision. Cassens, 354 Ill. App. 3d at 811, 821 N.E.2d at 1278. However, we also stated there was “no reason to limit the interpretation of ‘disability’ in Petrie to section 19(h)” and found the word had “the same definition for purposes of review of wage differential benefits under section 8(d)(1).” Cassens, 354 Ill. App. 3d at 810, 821 N.E.2d at 1277.\nIn Cassens, the supreme court granted the employer’s petition for leave to appeal and affirmed this court’s ultimate decision in the case. Cassens Transport Co. v. Industrial Comm’n, 218 Ill. 2d 519, 533, 844 N.E.2d 414, 423 (2006). It agreed that the Commission lacked jurisdiction to modify the claimant’s section 8(d)(1) award. Cassens, 218 Ill. 2d at 533, 844 N.E.2d at 423. However, the court determined it was unnecessary to address the employer’s arguments as to the definition of “disability” in section 8(d)(1) and found this court’s discussion of that issue was improper. Cassens, 218 Ill. 2d at 533, 844 N.E.2d at 423-24.\nIn rendering its decision, the supreme court held the duration clause of section 8(d)(1) “is meaningful to the Commission’s initial determination of the proper award in any section 8(d)(1) case.” Cassens, 218 Ill. 2d at 529, 844 N.E.2d at 422. “By its plain language, [section 8(d)(1)] allows arbitrators and the Commission the option of determining that a claimant’s disability is likely to end, abate, or increase after a certain duration, and awarding compensation accordingly.” Cassens, 218 Ill. 2d at 529, 844 N.E.2d at 422. Further, “the Act establishes that employees and employers alike must use the opportunity of their initial hearing to present evidence showing the likely duration of an injury and its effect on the claimant’s earning capacity.” Cassens, 218 Ill. 2d at 530, 844 N.E.2d at 422.\nThe supreme court noted that to obtain benefits under section 8(d)(1), the claimant “must prove (1) that he or she is partially incapacitated from pursuing his or her usual and customary line of employment and (2) that he or she has suffered an impairment in the wages he or she earns or is able to earn.” Cassens, 218 Ill. 2d at 531, 844 N.E.2d at 422. The second prong of the section 8(d)(1) inquiry “focuses on earning capacity, rather than the dollar amount of an employee’s take-home pay.” Cassens, 218 Ill. 2d at 531, 844 N.E.2d at 422.\nEmployer argues the supreme court’s analysis in Cassens supports its position. Citing various portions of the court’s decision, it contends that the court “made clear” that the reference to “disability” in section 8(d)(1) “addresses the physical/mental, as well as economic components of ‘disability’ for purposes of compensating the impairment of long-term earning capacity caused by the work injury.”\nEmployer confuses the court’s analysis of section 8(d)(1) as a whole with analysis of the phrase “duration of disability” or simply the word “disability.” A discussion of section 8(d)(1) necessarily encompasses economic factors because its purpose is to compensate an injured employee for his reduced earning capacity. It does not follow that the specific phrase “duration of disability” within section 8(d)(1) must refer to economic disability rather than the duration of a claimant’s physical or mental injury. As stated, the court expressly declined to address the issue of the definition of “disability” as used in section 8(d)(1). A clear reading of Cassens shows it does not stand for the proposition employer suggests.\nAdditionally, this court has previously rejected the argument that a wage differential award should end at the age of retirement. In Fritz Electric Co. v. Industrial Comm’n, 165 Ill. App. 3d 550, 561, 518 N.E.2d 1289, 1296 (1988), the employer argued the Commission erred by not limiting its wage differential award to when the claimant turned 65, “implying that such loss could be a lifelong award long after [the claimant’s] earning capacity would abate from retirement or nonrelated illness.” We noted the employer “cited no cases requiring an interpretation of th[e] statutory language [‘for the duration of his disability’] other than its plain, ordinary meaning” and we declined to read any such requirement into the Act. Fritz, 165 Ill. App. 3d at 561, 518 N.E.2d at 1296.\nThe definition of “disability” announced in Petrie also applies to the definition of the word as used in section 8(d)(1) of the Act. The supreme court’s decision in Cassens did not address this issue and does not alter the holding in Petrie. The Commission did not err by finding economic disability was not encompassed within the word “disability” as used in section 8(d)(1).\nThe Commission also committed no error by sustaining claimant’s objection to the evidence offered by employer regarding claimant’s work-life expectancy. Employer sought to admit testimony and a report from Dr. Eubanks, an economist, who opined claimant’s “age at the time she is expected to exit the work force is within a range of age 58.27 to age 67.00 with a mid-point of age 62.64.” His opinions were based on her gender, age, educational attainment level, status in the work force, trial date, and the Skoog and Ciecka work-life expectancy model.\nNot only are Dr. Eubanks’s opinions speculative, they are also irrelevant to a determination of wage differential benefits. As discussed, the word “disability” in section 8(d)(1) does not refer to economic disability and employer’s proffered evidence is not relevant to determining the “duration of [claimant’s] disability.” The opinion evidence also adds nothing to other wage-differential considerations such as claimant’s incapacitation from employment or the impairment in the wages she earned or was able to earn. The Commission committed no error.\nFor the reasons stated, we affirm the circuit court’s judgment, confirming the Commission.\nAffirmed.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}]
[{&#39;author&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE HARRIS&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE HARRIS\ndelivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\nJustices Karnezis and Connors concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nOPINION\nPlaintiff Leonard Kranzler loaned defendant Lewis Saltzman $100,000 upon the defendant signing a written “memo” that stated, “Loaned to Lewis Saltzman $100,000 to he paid back with interest.” The defendant intermittently made payments that partially repaid the loan. Within 10 years of the date of the defendant’s last payment on the loan, plaintiff filed suit in the circuit court of Cook County alleging the “memo” to be a promissory note and seeking judgment for the outstanding principal and interest. The trial court found in favor of plaintiff and against defendant, entering final judgment in the amount of $81,344.12 plus interest. Defendant then filed this appeal, claiming that plaintiffs complaint was time barred under any of three applicable statutes of limitations (810 ILCS 5/3—118(g) (West 2008); 735 ILCS 5/13—205, 13—206 (West 2008)). For the following reasons, we affirm.\nJURISDICTION\nThe trial court entered a final judgment in the instant case on January 27, 2009, and defendant filed his notice of appeal on February 26, 2009. Accordingly, this court has jurisdiction pursuant to Illinois Supreme Court Rules 301 and 303 governing appeals from final judgments entered below. Ill. S. Ct. R. 301 (eff. Feb. 1, 1994); Ill. S. Ct. R. 303 (eff. May 30, 2008).\nBACKGROUND\nOn March 10, 1997, plaintiff Leonard Kranzler loaned defendant Lewis Saltzman $100,000. Defendant signed a typewritten “memo” on that same date that read as follows:\n“Memo to: Leonard Kranzler\nMarch 10, 1997\nLoaned to Lewis Saltzman $100,000 to be paid back with interest.\n/s/ Lewis Saltzman”\nBetween November 30, 1999, and July 5, 2005, plaintiff received intermittent payments on the debt totaling $74,500. The payments ceased after July 5, 2005, and on June 29, 2007, plaintiff filed a complaint in the circuit court seeking judgment for the outstanding principal due on the loan along with interest accumulated to date. On November 14, 2007, plaintiff filed an amended complaint that stated the same allegations as the first complaint and added a calculation showing that the sum of the outstanding principal balance on the “promissory note,” plus all interest due and owing, totaled $160,241.38 as of October 31, 2007.\nWhen defendant failed to respond to plaintiffs amended complaint, plaintiff sought entry of a default judgment against defendant, which the trial court entered in favor of plaintiff on January 16, 2008, in the amount of $113,692.14. Defendant moved to vacate the default judgment within 30 days of the entry of default, and the trial court granted defendant’s motion to vacate on March 13, 2008.\nOn the same date, defendant moved for a judgment on the pleadings pursuant to section 2—615(e) of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/2—615(e) (West 2008)), alleging that plaintiff’s action was time barred by the statute of limitations provided by article III of the Uniform Commercial Code (810 ILCS 5/3—101 et seq. (West 2008)) as well as the 10-year statute of limitations for written contracts under section 13—206 of the Code of Civil Procedure (735 ILCS 5/13—206 (West 2008)). The trial court denied defendant’s motion on May 1, 2008, and allowed plaintiff to file a second amended complaint.\nPlaintiff filed his second amended complaint on May 1, 2008. It reiterated plaintiffs allegations in the two preceding complaints and enumerated 15 separate payments that were made on the loan between November 30, 1999, and July 5, 2005. Exhibit B to plaintiffs second amended complaint included excerpts from a deposition taken of defendant in an unrelated matter in which defendant admitted that plaintiff had loaned him $100,000 and that he had requested that his company, Saltzman Printers, Inc. (SPI), make payments on the loan. In his answers to plaintiff’s second amended complaint, defendant admitted that the 15 enumerated payments were made on the loan. In addition, in his response to plaintiff’s first request for admissions, defendant admitted that he was president, director, and shareholder of SPI and that he had directed SPI to make the 15 payments to plaintiff in partial repayment of the loan.\nOn September 24, 2008, plaintiff moved for summary judgment, alleging that defendant owed him $115,797.65 plus per diem interest. The trial court entered partial summary judgment on the issue of liability in favor of plaintiff on December 5, 2008, and set a hearing to determine the amount of interest owed.\nOn January 27, 2009, the trial court entered a judgment against defendant and in favor of plaintiff in the amount of $81,344.12. The decision also called for postjudgment interest to accrue at the rate of 9% per annum. Defendant then filed this timely appeal.\nANALYSIS\nDefendant appeals from the trial court’s judgment in favor of plaintiff and contends that the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss plaintiffs second amended complaint. We are not persuaded that the trial court erred.\nFirst, we have considered which statute of limitations applies in the instant case. The parties point to three different statutes of limitations in their briefs: 3 years for actions arising under article III of the Uniform Commercial Code (810 ILCS 5/3—118(g) (West 2008)), 5 years for actions on unwritten contracts and “all civil actions not otherwise provided for” (735 ILCS 5/13—205 (West 2008)), and 10 years for written contracts or “other evidences of indebtedness in writing” (735 ILCS 5/13—206 (West 2008)). The parties agreed during oral argument that the article III statute of limitations cannot apply because the document at issue here does not meet the requirements of a negotiable instrument. Defendant contends that the document was not a written contract and thus falls under the five-year statute of limitations for unwritten contracts. 735 ILCS 5/13—205 (West 2008). Plaintiff responds that the instrument contains all essential terms of a promise to pay and thus qualifies for the 10-year statute of limitations under section 13—206 (735 ILCS 5/13—206 (West 2008)). Which statute of limitations applies is a question of law that we review de novo. Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. v. Bowman, 229 Ill. 2d 461, 466 (2008).\nWe must first determine whether the document is merely a partial writing evidencing an oral agreement or a complete writing containing all essential terms. Where the writings attached to the complaint do not contain the essential terms of the contract, even if the essential terms may be easily ascertained elsewhere, the contract is not written but oral. Clark v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 141 Ill. App. 3d 174, 176 (1986). But a writing is complete “when the language of the instrument may fairly be construed to contain a promise to pay money or contains facts from which the law implies a promise to pay, so long as parol evidence is not necessary to establish any essential elements.” Toth v. Mansell, 207 Ill. App. 3d 665, 670 (1990) (finding that invoices, monthly statements, and ledgers did not constitute “ ‘other evidence of indebtedness’ ” because they could not establish the essential element of a promise to pay). When that writing is not simply a contract but also a promise to pay, then the writing constitutes “ ‘other evidence of indebtedness’ ” for the purposes of section 13—206 of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure. Toth, 207 Ill. App. 3d at 670; In re Estate of Garrett, 24 Ill. App. 3d 895, 899 (1975) (“If the language of a writing may fairly be construed to contain a promise to pay money, or if the instrument states a fact from which the law implies an obligation to pay and there is no need to resort to parol evidence in order to establish any essential elements of the agreement forming the basis of the action, the instrument is within [section 13—206 (735 ILCS 5/13—206 (West 2008))] founded upon ‘evidences of indebtedness in writing.’ ”); see also Portfolio Acquisitions, L.L.C. v. Feltman, 391 Ill. App. 3d 642, 652 (2009) (determining that a credit card contract was oral because the plaintiff debt collection agency did not present as evidence a copy of the cardholder agreement between defendant and the issuing bank of the credit card, and thus, parol evidence was necessary to show the essential terms and conditions of that contract as well as the relationship between the parties and the defendant’s receipt and acceptance of those essential terms); Held v. Held, 137 F.3d 998, 1000 (7th Cir. 1998) (finding that a written letter submitted as evidence of an express trust was not “other evidence of indebtedness” because it did not contain all of the essential elements of a trust agreement).\n•1 The essential elements or terms of a promise to pay are: (1) the parties to the agreement, (2) the nature of the transaction, (3) the amount in question, and (4) at least a reasonable implication of an intention to repay the debt. In re Estate of Garrett, 24 Ill. App. 3d at 898. In Garrett, the Second District considered an instrument similar to the one at issue here. There the parties disputed whether a handwritten note discovered in the decedent’s safety deposit box constituted written evidence of an oral contract or “ ‘other evidence of indebtedness.’ ” Garrett, 24 Ill. App. 3d at 897. One side of the piece of paper showed a paid promissory note in the amount of $5,000 and the other side held the handwritten note indicating that the claimant and a third person had lent decedent the funds to pay the promissory note and that decedent wished to repay the two men out of his estate. Id. The envelope containing this piece of paper also bore a note in the decedent’s handwriting indicating that he owed the claimant and the third party each $2,500. Id. On appeal, the court concluded that the notes did not constitute a written contract because they lacked mutuality; there was no evidence that the claimant had known of their existence prior to the death of the decedent. Id. at 898.\n•2 However, the Garrett court found that “being of a contractual nature, the writings do constitute ‘other evidences of indebtedness in writing.’ ” Id. The court reasoned:\n“Whether an action is based on a written contract or on any other evidence of indebtedness in writing, the action must be upon the writing and it is not enought [sic] that the evidence by which the cause of action is supported is in writing. [Citations.]\nThe writings before us are not, however, mere evidence of a previous oral agreement. They are by themselves complete, thus eliminating the necessity of resort to parol evidence. The parties to the agreement, the nature of the transaction, the amount in question and, at least by reasonable implication, an intention to repay the debt are indicated therein. Accordingly, the writings come within the purview of [section 13—206 (735 ILCS 5/13—206 (West 2008))].” Garrett, 24 Ill. App. 3d at 898.\nThus, a written instrument evidencing a promise to pay qualifies as “other evidence of indebtedness in writing” for purposes of the 10-year statute of limitations so long as the writing contains all essential terms of a promise to pay. Id.\n•3 As in Garrett, the instrument at the heart of the dispute in the instant case contains all of the essential elements of a promise to pay. First, the instrument names the parties to the agreement: plaintiff and defendant. Second, it clearly establishes the nature of the transaction. Plaintiff loaned money to defendant. Third, the amount in question is readily apparent: $100,000 plus interest. Finally, the instrument contains evidence of the debtor’s intent to repay the loan. The instrument reads “to be paid back with interest” and is signed by defendant, the debtor. At the very least, this is a reasonable implication of defendant’s intent to repay the loan. See id.\nDefendant contends that because the rate of interest is not specified in the instrument, parol evidence is required to establish the amount in question and thus the document does not contain all es sential terms. However, defendant cites to no cases in support of this argument and we have not found any that would bolster his position. In addition, defendant contends that it is unclear from the face of the instrument exactly whom he should repay. This is a spurious argument when the instrument clearly states the person who loaned defendant the money, and defendant has not cited to any case law holding otherwise. See Ill. S. Ct. R. 341(h)(7) (eff. July 1, 2008); Dillon v. Evanston Hospital, 199 Ill. 2d 483, 493 (2002) (“ ‘A court of review is entitled to have the issues clearly defined and to be cited pertinent authority. A point not argued or supported by citation to relevant authority fails to satisfy the requirements of Rule 341([h])(7).’ ”).\nAccordingly, we find that the instrument presented here constitutes “other evidence of indebtedness in writing” and thus falls within the purview of the 10-year statute of limitations in section 13—206 of the Illinois Code of Civil Procedure.\n•4 Now we must consider when that 10-year statute of limitations began to run in order to discern whether the instant action was timely filed. Defendant contends that the statute of limitations began to run the first day after the loan was made. Plaintiff argues, on the other hand, that the statute of limitations began to run on the date of the last payment made on the debt, and we find plaintiff’s argument persuasive here.\nDefendant cites to Kozasa v. Guardian Electric Manufacturing Co., 99 Ill. App. 3d 669 (1981), for the proposition that “[a] cause of action accrues and the statute of limitations begins to run when a creditor may legally demand payment from a debtor.” Kozasa, 99 Ill. App. 3d at 673. However, Kozasa does not hold that the statute of limitations begins to run the first day after a debtor makes a promise to pay, as defendant argues. Rather, the court found that when a debtor has been making payments on a debt, the statute of limitations begins to run, not when the debtor threatens to stop making payments under the contract, but instead when the next payment becomes due and remains unpaid. Id. In Kozasa the plaintiff had designed a relay used in electrical products and orally contracted with the defendant, an electronics component manufacturer, to arrange for an overseas supplier to manufacture the relays. Id. at 670-71. The parties entered into their oral agreement on November 16, 1967, and during December 1969 and January 1970 the defendant unilaterally attempted to alter the terms of the deal, culminating with sending the plaintiff a “ ‘final check *** under the old arrangement’ ” on January 19, 1970. Id. at 672. During this time, the defendant had been making periodic payments to the plaintiff under their oral agreement and only ceased this practice when it failed to make the scheduled February payment. Id. at 674. The court found that no breach of the contract occurred until defendant failed to make that scheduled payment and thus the statute of limitations began to run from the time of the breach, which was the first time that the plaintiff could legally demand payment from the defendant. Id.\nMoreover, defendant’s argument ignores the language of the applicable statute of limitations. As noted, section 13—206 states, “actions on *** other evidences of indebtedness in writing *** shall be commenced within 10 years next after the cause of action accrued; but if any payment or new promise to pay has been made, in writing, on any *** other written evidence of indebtedness, within or after the period of 10 years, then an action may be commenced thereon at any time within 10 years after the time of such payment or promise to pay.” (Emphasis added.) 735 ILCS 5/13—206 (West 2008). Accordingly, when payments have been made on a debt instrument that qualifies as “other evidence of indebtedness in writing” under section 13—206, the statute of limitations begins to run from the date of the last payment made, even if 10 years had already run on the statute of limitations by the time of the last payment. See Krajcir v. Egidi, 305 Ill. App. 3d 613, 622 (1999) (finding that a plaintiff who filed his complaint within 10 years of the last payment made on a nonnegotiable promissory note had timely filed).\nIn the instant case, defendant signed the instrument on March 10, 1997, but plaintiff did not file his complaint until June 29, 2007. However, plaintiffs second amended complaint alleges that 15 payments were made on the instrument between July 1, 1997, and July 5, 2005. Although defendant denies in his briefs on appeal that he ever made such payments or caused them to be made, he admitted in his response to plaintiffs first request for admissions that during his tenure as president, director, and shareholder of SPI he caused SPI to make 15 payments on the instrument between November 30, 1999, and September 26, 2003. Any one of these payments would have been sufficient to trigger a new 10-year limitations period under section 13—206 and thus we find that plaintiffs complaint was timely filed.\nCONCLUSION\nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the circuit court of Cook County.\nAffirmed.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}]
[{&#39;author&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE LAVIN&#39;, &#39;text&#39;: &#39;JUSTICE LAVIN\ndelivered the judgment of the court, with opinion.\nPresiding Justice Gallagher and Justice Pucinski concurred in the judgment and opinion.\nOPINION\nThis appeal stems from real estate partnerships that were formed nearly two decades ago to develop shopping centers in two suburbs largely financed through tax increment financing (TIE) bonds. This matter was litigated in the chancery division of the circuit court of Cook County for more than eight years and appellants-intervenors’ cause of action was dismissed in two separate orders entered in 2005 and 2009, both times for a lack of standing. On appeal, appellants contend that both counts of their complaint were improperly dismissed. For the reasons discussed at length below, we reverse and remand.\nI. BACKGROUND\nThe partnerships in question were formed by various persons who were employed in a Chicago real estate development firm. Appellants, intervening plaintiffs (intervenors) below, were limited partners in two Illinois limited partnerships: I.B.E Limited Partnership (IBP) and TB Limited Partnership (TB), of which Dennis J. Hiffman, John E. Shaffer, E. Thomas Collins, Jr., Daniel G. Anderson, and Richard E. Hulina (defendants) were the general partners in one or both of the partnerships. Defendants were principals in HSA Commercial Real Estate, Inc. (HSA), in the early 1990s, with intervenors then being either employees or contractors of HSA.\nThe first involved partnership, IBP was formed by defendants in January 1992 for the purpose of developing a shopping center in Bed-ford Park, Illinois. Various employees and contractors of HSA were offered the opportunity to become limited partners of IBP in exchange for a nominal capital contribution of $10 per 1% of ownership. Intervenors Mark Munaretto and William Skrzelowski each became a 0.5% limited partner in this entity. The second partnership, TB, was formed in May 1993 by Hiffman, Shaffer, Collins and Hulina, for the purposes of acquiring and developing property in Broadview, Illinois. Again, employees and contractors were offered the opportunity to buy into the partnership as limited partners for $10 per 1% of ownership. In July 1993, intervenors John Girsch, Edward Zifkin, and Mark Wheeles each became 0.5% limited partners, and Munaretto became a 0.75% limited partner.\nSimply stated, the two projects undertaken by IBP and TB involved substantial real estate redevelopment. The general partners planned to utilize TIE bonds issued by the respective municipalities involved in the projects. TIE bonds are financial instruments issued by municipalities to assist in the funding of redevelopment projects in designated areas. See 65 ILCS 5/11—74.4 et seq. (West 2008). The principal and interest on TIE bonds are paid from the increase in real estate taxes, and sales taxes in certain cases, that is anticipated to occur from a successful redevelopment project. IBP and TB entered into separate redevelopment agreements with the Villages of Bedford Park and Broadview, and pursuant to the agreements, each village issued senior lien TIE bonds (Senior Bonds) to the partnerships. Bedford Park issued $10.5 million in Senior Bonds and Broadview issued $23 million, with William Blair &amp; Company and Dain Bosworth acting as the respective underwriters.\nIn addition to the Senior Bonds, the two villages agreed to issue TIE bonds subordinate to the Senior Bonds. Bedford Park issued “Developer Bonds” with a face value of $7 million and Broadview issued “Junior Bonds” in the amount of $8 million. Because the Developer and Junior Bonds were subordinate to the Senior Bonds, principal and interest would only be paid to the holders in the event that the incremental tax revenues exceeded the amounts required to satisfy all the principal and interest payments of the Senior Bonds. One of the general partners, E. Thomas Collins, Jr., stated in a sworn affidavit and a deposition that it was discussed and understood between the limited and general partners that the subordinate bonds would be taken by the general partners due to the personal investments they had made in creating the projects. Interveners, on the other hand, deny being notified that the general partners would acquire the Junior or Development Bonds for themselves and the partnership agreements themselves were silent on the subject.\nIn any event, the Developer Bonds were issued in June 1992 to IBE which were then purchased by the general partners of IBP for $550,000, netting the partners $5,500 per percentage point of interest. The purchase was disclosed to the limited partners in a June 11, 1992, letter, which also enclosed checks payable in appropriate amounts to each partner. The purchase price was based on a draft valuation letter by Charles Freeburg of William Blair &amp; Company. In a separate transaction, the Junior Bonds were issued directly to the general partners of TB around September 1994. The issuance was treated as a distribution against their partnership capital accounts, which were reduced by the face amount of the Junior Bonds.\nIn the several years subsequent to the bond transactions, the redevelopment projects eventually became successful, and as a result, tax revenues were generated in excess of the projects’ projections. Because of this, the Senior Bonds’ obligations were able to be fulfilled (with cash distributions being made to all partners) and the Developer and Junior Bonds, in turn, increased in value. The transactions revolving around the Developer and Junior Bonds, and other certain events outlined below, would eventually serve as the basis of interveners’ allegations of a breach of fiduciary duty by defendants.\nA. TB Partnership Events and Proceedings\nIn 1999, Broadview unexpectedly refinanced the Senior and Junior Bonds. New bonds with lower interest rates were issued, and pursuant to the redemption provision of the original Junior Bonds, Broadview paid defendants, as general partners of TB, $9 million in order to redeem the bonds. Up to that point, the general partners of TB were paid approximately $4.35 million in interest payments as well. In 2001, Melissa S. Pielet, individually and derivatively on behalf of IBP and TB, filed an action against the defendants, alleging that they breached their fiduciary duties to the partnerships by transferring the subordinated bonds to themselves for their own benefit. The parties subsequently engaged in discovery and motion practice for over a year. During that time, Broadview Village Center (the shopping mall owned and developed by TB) lost two large tenants. As a result, TB’s rental income fell short of its financial obligations and an action to foreclose was initiated against TB’s mortgage.\nTo avoid foreclosure, TB developed a complex plan to recapitalize and restructure its debts. A key component of the plan included plans to negotiate a contract with Wal-Mart where, among other things, it would purchase from TB a vacant building in the Broadview Village Center along with the underlying real estate. To implement the plan, however, it was determined that TB would require $5.5 million in cash, thus triggering a “capital call” under which the partners would all contribute funds in proportionate share to meet the financial needs of the partnership. In this particular agreement, the limited partners were not required to contribute, but it provided that any partner who declined to contribute would forfeit his or her partnership interest. The capital call in question was set to occur on September 30, 2003.\nAround the same time, the general partners proposed to settle Pielet’s action by making a $5.5 million loan to TB themselves in place of the capital call. In December 2003, Pielet withdrew as a plaintiff from the action she initiated and Keith Bank, another limited partner, then filed and was granted a motion for leave to intervene as party plaintiff. Shortly thereafter, however, intervenors averred that Mr. Bank was not representing the partnerships in their best interests. They then sought and obtained leave to intervene in this action in February 2004.\nIn March 2004, the circuit court ordered defendants to issue a notice of their proposed settlement to all partners of TB. The notice explained that under the proposed settlement, the capital call would be suspended and that no limited partner would forfeit an interest in TB by failing to contribute a proportionate share. The obligation to contribute, however, would be reinstated if the loan or settlement was terminated. Intervenors initiated proceedings objecting to the proposed settlement and requested the circuit court to disapprove it. Fairness hearings were conducted in May 2004 but before the circuit court could rule, defendants filed a notice withdrawing the proposed settlement, explaining that Wal-Mart had terminated its contract and would not be purchasing the building or real estate as anticipated, thwarting the original refinancing strategy. The $5.5 million capital call was reinstated, and each partner was notified that he or she had 30 days, or until July 30, 2004, to elect whether to contribute a proportionate share of the call pursuant to the agreement.\nOn the penultimate day before the effectiveness of the capital call, intervenors filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO), seeking to prevent defendants from foreclosing their partnership interests in the event intervenors chose not to contribute to the capital call. The motion was denied after a lengthy and spirited argument in open court and intervenors were specifically notified by the trial court that if they did not contribute their proportionate share of the capital call, they “would be out of business.” Intervenors declined to contribute, which ineluctably led to a motion to dismiss the claims relating to TB, namely, count II of intervenors’ amended complaint, arguing that intervenors lacked standing to pursue their claims after forfeiting their interests. The circuit court granted the motion to dismiss in a written order on March 24, 2005. Intervenors filed a “Corrected Amended Complaint,” which defendants again moved to dismiss due to a lack of standing. The motion was granted on December 8, 2005, in one of the written orders from which intervenors appeal.\nB. IBP Partnership Events and Proceedings\nThe only intervenors who held interest in IBP were Skrzelowski and Munaretto. The IBP partnership agreement provided that the partnership could repurchase the interest of any limited partner who terminates his or her employment with the partnership or a related entity. Paragraph 17 of the IBP partnership agreement provides for a “Repurchase Option of the Partnership.” In the event that a limited partner terminated his employment with “the Partnership or any entity in which any Partner is affiliated,” the terminated partner “shall give written notice to the Partnership which shall state all details regarding such Repurchase Event.” The provision further provides that if the terminated partner fails to give notice of repurchase, the partnership itself may give such notice on behalf of the terminated partner “at any time thereafter.” At that point, the partnership has the option to acquire the partnership interest of the terminated partner.\nMunaretto and Skrzelowski left HSA in 1993 and 1994, respectively, but neither individual ever issued a repurchase notice as called for in the agreement. After another dispositive motion failed in the trial court, on April 17, 2009, IBP issued repurchase notices to Munaretto and Skrzelowski pursuant to the authorization in the IBP partnership agreement. Included with the notice was a repurchase agreement providing that their interests would be purchased by IBP according to a valuation provision within the IBP partnership agreement, which essentially provided that the difference between a limited partner’s initial investment and the amount of cash distributions received is the repurchase value. Although Munaretto and Skrzelowski did not execute and return their respective agreements, the IBP partnership agreement contained a power of attorney provision allowing the general partners to execute such a document on their behalf. On April 30, 2009, the agreements were accordingly executed by a general partner. After Munaretto’s and Skrezlowski’s interests were repurchased, defendants filed a motion to dismiss their claims for lack of standing. On August 13, 2009, the circuit court granted the motion in a written order. Intervenors now timely appeal.\nII. ANALYSIS\nA. Dismissal of Count II (TB)\nOn appeal, intervenors first contend that the circuit court improperly dismissed count II of their amended complaint. More specifically, they argue that they sufficiently alleged individual claims for restoration and thus count II should not have been dismissed for lack of standing. Count II alleged a breach of fiduciary duty regarding TB, concerning the transaction of the Junior Bonds to defendants. The circuit court’s written order stated that defendants sought to dismiss count II because the intervenors failed to state an individual claim. Having found that the intervenors were no longer members of the partnership involved in count II, the circuit court next found they no longer had standing to bring claims on behalf of the partnership. The order also noted that while plaintiffs “do now make a claim for restoration of their partnership interests, they allege no facts of individual harm that would entitle them to such restoration.”\nDefendants’ motion to dismiss was based upon sections 2—615 and 2—619 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Code) (735 ILCS 5/2—615, 2—619 (West 2008)). A motion to dismiss under section 2—615 admits all well-pleaded facts and attacks the legal sufficiency of the complaint. La Salle National Bank v. City Suites, Inc., 325 Ill. App. 3d 780, 790 (2001). A motion to dismiss under section 2—619, on the other hand, admits the legal sufficiency of the complaint but raises defects, defenses, or other affirmative matters that appear on the face of the complaint or are established by external submissions that act to defeat the claim. Krilich v. American National Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Chicago, 334 Ill. App. 3d 563, 569-70 (2002). We review an order granting a motion to dismiss pursuant to section 2—615 or section 2—619 de novo. Illinois Non-Profit Risk Management Ass’n v. Human Service Center of Southern Metro-East, 378 Ill. App. 3d 713, 719 (2008). Furthermore, when reviewing motions under either section 2—615 or 2—619, we accept all well-pleaded facts in the complaint as true and draw all reason able inferences from those facts in favor of the nonmoving party in order to determine whether a cause of action can be sustained. Dopkeen v. Whitaker, 399 Ill. App. 3d 682, 684 (2010).\nA partnership is a contractual relationship, and as such, contract law applies and a partnership is accordingly controlled by the terms of the agreement under which it is formed. Fisher v. Parks, 248 Ill. App. 3d 666, 674-75 (1993). If the written agreement is unambiguous, the court must construe the parties’ intent from the writing itself as a matter of law and effectuate its plain and ordinary meaning. Buenz v. Frontline Transportation Co., 227 Ill. 2d 302, 308 (2008). However, no language in an agreement, however clear and explicit, can reduce a partner’s fiduciary duty. See 1515 North Wells, L.P. v. 1513 North Wells, L.L.C., 392 Ill. App. 3d 863, 874 (2009). The existence of a fiduciary relationship between all partners is well established, and each partner is bound to exercise the utmost good faith and honesty in all matters relating to the partnership business. Winston &amp; Strawn v. Nosal, 279 Ill. App. 3d 231, 239-40 (1996). Illinois has held that this fiduciary duty “prohibits all forms of secret dealings and self-preference in any [partnership] matter” (Winston &amp; Strawn, 279 Ill. App. 3d at 239-40; see Bakalis v. Bressler, 1 Ill. 2d 72, 79 (1953); Labovitz v. Dolan, 189 Ill. App. 3d 403, 412 (1989)), and also “requires each partner to fully disclose partnership business to other partners” (Winston &amp; Strawn, 279 Ill. App. 3d at 240 (citing Borys v. Rudd, 207 Ill. App. 3d 610, 620 (1990))).\nWe initially note that the circuit court ruled after intervenors’ emergency TRO motion that the capital call issued by TB was “indeed authorized by the terms of the agreement” between the partners. This finding is not disputed on appeal. Intervenors did not contribute their required share of the capital call, and pursuant to the terms of TB’s partnership agreement, they forfeited any interest they had in the partnership. Subsequently, defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of standing, which the circuit court granted.\nSuperficially, dismissal would appear proper based on the rules of standing because, generally, individuals cannot maintain a derivative action against a partnership if they have no interest in the partnership. See Caparos v. Morton, 364 Ill. App. 3d 159, 167-68 (2006); Lower v. Lanark Mutual Fire Insurance Co., 151 Ill. App. 3d 471, 473 (1986). Intervenors, however, point to Labovitz v. Dolan, 189 Ill. App. 3d 403 (1989), in support of their argument that their cause of action should not have been dismissed. In Labovitz, the plaintiffs were former limited partners in a partnership with the defendant general partner who had sole management discretion pursuant to the underlying partnership agreement. The partnership incurred significant tax obligations but the general partner withheld cash distributions that would have covered plaintiffs’ associated pro rata share. Plaintiffs sold their partnership interests to the general partner at a “bargain price” due to the economic burden but subsequently filed a complaint against the general partner for breach of fiduciary duty. The plaintiffs’ complaint was dismissed by the circuit court, which held that the general partner’s acts were within the broad discretion granted to him by the partnership agreement. On appeal, this court reversed and remanded, holding that a general partner’s broad discretion in the cash distributions of the partnership does not trump, but instead exists concurrently with, the general partner’s fiduciary duty owed to the limited partners in dealing with them and the assets of the partnership. Labovitz, 189 Ill. App. 3d at 412. Although Labovitz is, in a sense, factually dissimilar, we nevertheless find it to be substantively instructive.\nHere, intervenors’ complaint alleges that defendants breached their fiduciary duties by: (1) misappropriating the Junior Bonds; and (2) issuing a capital call that was only necessitated by their alleged misappropriation. While we are not bound to accept the complaint’s conclusory allegations, as noted above, we accept all well-pleaded facts in the complaint as true and will draw all reasonable inferences from those facts in favor of the nonmoving party in order to determine whether a cause of action can be sustained. Dopkeen, 399 Ill. App. 3d at 684. With this in mind, a close examination of the complaint and record raises a number of concerns regarding the defendants’ acts revolving around the transaction of the Junior Bonds. First, although Collins’ affidavit asserts that he and other general partners had somehow related to the intervenors that the Junior Bonds would be only for the benefit of the general partners, it is telling that the TB partnership agreement is completely silent on the issue. Second, the bond trustee for the Village of Broadview was apparently directed to issue the Junior Bonds directly to the general partners. This event is highly suspect given the language within the applicable redevelopment agreement between TB and the Village of Broadview indicating that any Junior Bonds issued would be delivered to and purchased by the “Developer,” which includes TB as a whole but not the general partners as a discrete entity. Third, from the record and complaint it appears that at the time of the Junior Bonds’ issuance, intervenors were unaware of the events surrounding the transaction of the Junior Bonds. Finally, we note that in apparent consideration for the Junior Bonds, the capital accounts of the general partners were reduced; however, the limited partners did not actually receive any cash distributions as a result of the Junior Bond transaction. The defendants, on the other hand, ultimately received over $13 million as a result of owning the Junior Bonds.\nFundamentally, we find the instant case to be analogous to Labovitz, where a general partner’s management discretion was used in breach of a fiduciary duty and created the loss of a limited partner’s interest through economic coercion. We reiterate that while we offer no opinion as to the merits of the underlying case, when we take intervenors’ well-pleaded facts as time and draw the reasonable inferences therefrom, the allegation remains that the general partners, through their management discretion and authority, obfuscated the personal taking of the Junior Bonds originally designated as partnership assets, which resulted in a financial windfall to them of over $13 million. The partnership then experienced a shortage of funds and the general partners imposed a financial obligation upon the intervenors, resulting in their loss of interests in TB. Permitting intervenors’ cause of action to be dismissed, and essentially validating their loss of interest, by pointing to management discretion and authority without consideration of the overarching principles of partnership fiduciary duties here would miss the forest for the trees. As Labovitz discussed in detail, “partners owe each other the duty to exercise the highest degree of honesty, fairness and good faith in their dealings with one another and in the handling of partnership assets,” also noting that a greater duty rests upon the general partners. Labovitz, 189 Ill. App. 3d at 408-09. The record casts defendants’ actions into doubt and to allow dismissal under these circumstances is contrary to the principles of partnership fiduciary duty established above, and we hold that the trial court erred in dismissing count II.\nB. Dismissal of Count I (IBP)\nIntervenors next contend that the circuit court improperly dismissed count I of their amended complaint. Count I of the amended complaint related to the Developer Bonds which were purchased by the general partners from IBP The circuit court dismissed count I in 2009 because intervenors Munaretto and Skrzelowski lacked standing to maintain the action after IBP repurchased their partnership interests pursuant to the partnership agreement. Because the circuit court dismissed the count under section 2—619 of the Code, we review this issue de novo. Illinois Non-Profit Risk Management Ass’n, 378 Ill. App. 3d at 719. On appeal, intervenors base their arguments for reversal on waiver, laches, and general principles of inequity. As a threshold matter, we observe that intervenors do not dispute that the repurchase of their interests were, as a technical matter, properly executed pursuant to the IBP partnership agreement or that their claim is a derivative action. Intervenors’ arguments regarding the repurchase option in the IBP partnership agreement are based upon waiver, laches, and equity.\nAs a threshold matter, we must find that waiver and laches provide little help to intervenors here. Waiver is the intentional relinquishment of a known right, and may be express or implied. Midwest Builder Distributing, Inc. v. Lord &amp; Essex, Inc., 383 Ill. App. 3d 645, 673 (2007). While implied waiver of a right can arise through conduct inconsistent with an intent to enforce that right, the party seeking waiver carries the burden of “proving a clear, unequivocal, and decisive act of its opponent manifesting an intention to waive its rights.” In re Nitz, 317 Ill. App. 3d 119, 130 (2000). As gleaned from the record and confirmed during oral arguments before this court, it is apparent that defendants were unaware of the repurchase option written into their own contract until shortly before exercising it. Given that waiver requires the party to be aware of the right, as it is an intentional relinquishment of a known right, we cannot say that defendants here technically waived the right to exercise the repurchase option clause.\nIntervenors’ argument revolving around laches suffers from a different, but equally fatal, legal infirmity. Generally, laches is an equitable doctrine precluding litigants from asserting a claim when prejudice occurs as a result of a litigant’s unreasonable delay in raising that claim. Madigan v. Yballe, 397 Ill. App. 3d 481, 493 (2009). The two fundamental elements of laches are (1) a lack of due diligence by the party asserting the claim; and (2) prejudice to the opposing party. Gersch v. Department of Professional Regulation, 308 Ill. App. 3d 649, 661 (1999). We have held that laches is an affirmative defense and, as such, is simply unavailable to a party that is not a defendant. Malatesta v. Mitsubishi Aircraft International, Inc., 275 Ill. App. 3d 370, 386 (1995); see Wolfram Partnership, Ltd. v. LaSalle National Bank, 328 Ill. App. 3d 207, 225 n.10 (2001) (noting that laches may be proper to bar defendants’ counterclaim but not to prevent defendants’ assertion of a forfeiture of a lease agreement through default). Although count I was dismissed based on a lack of standing through defendants’ motion, defendants have not raised any counterclaim to which intervenors are a defendant. Accordingly, we find the doctrine of laches to be inapplicable here.\nIntervenors lastly argue that it would be inequitable to allow defendants to exercise the repurchase option. Given the specific circumstances of the instant case, we are persuaded that they should prevail on this argument. Intervenors argue that a court of equity is duty-bound to examine substance rather than the form of a transaction (Reese v. Melahn, 53 Ill. 2d 508, 513 (1973)), and the maxim that “equity considers that as done which ought to be done” (Cesena v. Du Page County, 145 Ill. 2d 32, 38 (1991)). Along with these general principles, we reiterate that the fiduciary duties discussed above relat ing to TB’s partners exist with equal strength here among IBP’s partners as well. Furthermore, we have held that “ ‘[a] convenant of good faith and fair dealing is implicit in every contract as a matter of law.’ ” Horwitz v. Sonnenschein Nath &amp; Rosenthal, LLP, 399 Ill. App. 3d 965, 978 (2010) (quoting Franz v. Calaco Development Corp., 352 Ill. App. 3d 1129, 1152 (2004)). A reason this convenant is implied is to protect the parties such that no party takes advantage of another “in a way that could not have been contemplated at the time the contract was drafted.” Gore v. Indiana Insurance Co., 376 Ill. App. 3d 282, 286 (2007). Disputes involving the exercise of good faith generally arise when one party is given broad discretion in performing its obligations under the contract, and therefore “[t]he duty of good faith and fair dealing is a limitation on the exercise of that discretion, requiring the party vested with discretion to exercise it reasonably and with proper motive, not arbitrarily, capriciously, or in a manner inconsistent with the parties’ reasonable expectations.” Gore, 376 Ill. App. 3d at 286.\nAccording to a sworn declaration by John E. Shaffer, the purpose in offering partnership interests to Munaretto and Skrzelowski was to motivate them as HSA employees. Should they somehow sever their associations with HSA, Shaffer stated that there would be no relevance in motivating them as an HSA employee and the repurchase clause within the IBP partnership agreement served as the vehicle to buy back their interests. An examination of the underlying proceedings, however, indicates that the exercise of the repurchase option could have been effected when Munaretto and Skrzelowski left HSA in the early 1990s. Despite this, defendants participated in the subsequent litigation for more than eight years. In 2009, after having a different dispositive motion fail before the trial court, defendants appeared to adjust their strategy. As stated during oral arguments before us, after a careful rereading of the IBP partnership agreement, defendants decided to exercise the repurchase option and shortly thereafter filed a motion to dismiss intervenors’ claims for a lack of standing. The motivation behind the exercise of that right was not to buy back interests of limited partners no longer associated with HSA, but primarily to simply remove intervenors’ standing. Doing so is an exercise of discretion that was utilized in a manner inconsistent with the parties’ reasonable expectations. While we acknowledge that repurchase options may legitimately serve a variety of purposes, they cannot operate to remove a party’s standing under circumstances like those in the case sub judice. Accordingly, count I was improperly dismissed and we reverse.\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment of the circuit court of Cook County and remand for further proceedings.\nReversed and remanded.\nThe underlying litigation was initially commenced by Melissa S. Pielet; however, she later withdrew. Another individual, Keith Bank, assumed Pielet’s role as party plaintiff for a short time, but also withdrew. Appellants, consist ing of Mark Munaretto, William Skrzelowski, John Girsch, Edward Zifkin, and Mark Wheeles, filed a motion to intervene which was granted and thereby became the intervening plaintiffs below.&#39;, &#39;type&#39;: &#39;majority&#39;}]
